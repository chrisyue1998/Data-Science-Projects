       "{'Has an old-fashioned, rustic quality, an acidic, bone-dry wine with sour cherry and dark unsweetened chocolate flavors that finish with some bitterness. Brings to mind those old-style Chiantis.',\n",
       " \"This dry, spicy wine shows the rustic, rugged quality that often accompanies Dry Creek Cabs. It has the briary texture of a Zinfandel, but with Cabernet's classic blackberry and black currant profile. Drink now–2012.\",\n",
       " 'Beautiful Zin, lush and decadent and heady. Hits you with the most wonderfully ripe chocolate, blackberry and cherry marmalade, licorice and spice flavors that are so rich, they would be gooey without the balancing acids and tannins. Drink this wine with the richest possible fare, like short ribs of beef.',\n",
       " \"A blend of Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling and Pinot Gris. It's crisp and clean in acidity, with zesty flavors of pineapples, oranges, mangoes and vanilla. If only it were drier, the score would be much higher.\",\n",
       " 'Soft and charming, with jammy cherry, blackberry and chocolate-covered mint flavors. The wine flirts with off-dryness, but its crisp acidity provides a welcome balance.',\n",
       " \"Despite alcohol listed at 15.4%, this seems thin, with watery cherry fruit and not much else. A plastic sensation is all that's left after a quick finish.\",\n",
       " \"Tasted pre-release, this is clearly ready for prime time. It's both compact and generous, with a core of wild berries soaked in minerals. The words lucid and crystalline come to mind—rarely applied to a red wine, let alone Cab Franc.\",\n",
       " 'This displays extraordinary fruit flavors, along with a dense, deep minerality. The flavors seamlessly blend berry, rock, graphite, fresh herb, and light barrel notes. But the fruit! Ripe and rich and aggressively full bodied. Berries piled upon earth and rock, and the flavors linger forever.',\n",
       " 'Lusty and ripe, jam-packed with upfront raspberries and cherries. A little lacking in complexity, but likeable for sheer deliciousness.',\n",
       " \"With forward flavors of raspberries, cherries, cola and cloves, this Pinot has become mellow over the years. It's a little too soft, and could use greater structure, but it's still a pretty wine. Drink up.\",\n",
       " 'Another Fenestra-Silvaspoons collaboration, Tourvanillo is a proprietary blend of Iberian grapes, predominantly Touriga, and is marked mostly by its aromatic highlights of spicy cinnamon and vibrant currant. Dense, it is interesting and intense with rounded edges and a leathery, long finish.',\n",
       " \"Despite its rich ripeness, this wine is a bit lighter in alcohol and tighter than Loring's other releases. The tannins and acids suggest midterm cellaring, but if you drink it now, you'll like the richness of the black cherry compote, mocha, Oriental spice and toast flavors.\",\n",
       " 'Made from hand-picked grapes and unfiltered, this is a richly concentrated, full-bodied Merlot with an abundance of sweet, juicy black plum and freshly roasted coffee flavors. Two years of aging in French oak results in a supple, silky wine with beautifully integrated tannins and pleasant notes of darkly toasted wood. A great pairing with roasted pork tenderloin.',\n",
       " 'A fairly priced varietal wine, this shows currant, cranberry, raisin and a flurry of allspice on the nose. It takes on rose petal and lavender aromas as it opens, making it all the more pleasant and memorable.',\n",
       " \"A vineyard along the Silverado Trail in Napa, not far from the winery, Grande was planted in 1920 and is still farmed by the original farmer's family, Dorothy and Tony Rossi. Here, it offers structure and elegance despite a brooding weight and power, the flavors leaning toward blackberry and licorice.\",\n",
       " \"Very dry and sharp in acidity, with a citrusy bite, like a hit of lime. The Cabernet-Merlot flavors are very rich, suggesting blackberries, black cherries and dark chocolate. The tannins are mountain tough. Altogether, it's a tough, rugged wine that could improve in the bottle.\",\n",
       " 'Made from the Happy Canyon area, this Cabernet Sauvignon-based Bordeaux blend has good blackberry, cherry, currant, cocoa and cedar flavors, and is dry and richly tannic. The main drawback is sharp acidity that would be considered a flaw in most Napa Valley Cabs. Ready now.',\n",
       " \"Off-dry with a candied orange character, this is indeed a mélange, including portions of seven different white wine grapes. It's an interesting wine, though might prove a bit challenging to match to food. Perhaps a curry?\",\n",
       " 'A fine Petite Sirah, dark, full bodied and dry, with ripe flavors of blackberries, mocha, leather, herbs and spices. Feels good and clean in the mouth, with chewy tannins and a long, rich finish.',\n",
       " 'This is a medium-bodied Zinfandel, with elegant weight and mouthfeel. The flavors are classic—wild raspberries and cherries, cola, cocoa and exotic spices. This is surely one of the best Zinfandels of the vintage.',\n",
       " \"Lots of people will be attracted to this wine, especially at this price. It's clean and crisp, with slightly sweet citrus, peach, green apple and vanilla flavors. Easy to find, with 25,000 cases produced.\",\n",
       " 'A very seductive nose with both power and flower in full array. The floral components are unusual and show exceptional winemaking talent. Very chocolaty, smooth, with the purity of cassis fruit and the power of fully ripe tannins to back up the barrel flavors. It fades gently into the finish, leaving behind that lovely chocolate and a trail of dark fruits.',\n",
       " 'Tastes like orange, apricot and cherry sweet-and-sour sauce you get in a Chinese restaurant over pork or chicken. The flavors are of those fruits, with some white sugar and rice vinegar.',\n",
       " 'A deeply impressive Bordeaux blend. It comes from this small, but prestigious, appellation, which is a bridge between Sonoma County and Napa Valley. Marked by dryness and a superb tannic structure, it has deep flavors of blackberries, black currants, violets, herbs and cedar. Needs time. Give it 4–6 years in the cellar.',\n",
       " 'Very dry and crisp, showing plenty of gooseberry flavors that verge on feline spray but stop just short. Enriched with lemons and limes, honey and vanilla. This is a good price for a delightful Sauvignon Blanc.',\n",
       " 'Well-made, with clean, bright fruit and lots of pretty new oak. The wine is beautifully balanced, elegant with a long, rich, toasty finish. Fairly light fruit in this vintage, but well handled and perfectly showcased.',\n",
       " 'Stillwater Creek may prove to be one of the great Grenache sites in Washington, which is experiencing a state-wide renaissance with the grape. This is a stellar effort, bursting with juicy red fruit, bourbon barrel, candied cherries, and a finishing layer of sweet chocolate. Though it bursts onto the palate with a rainbow of fruit flavor, it persists and shows both depth and length as well. Lovely.',\n",
       " 'This wine has very intense vegetal, stemmy aromas and flavors. It was aged entirely in stainless steel.',\n",
       " 'This young wine has not come into focus; it feels off center and disjointed. Components include a mix of sour red fruit, which drops off quickly, and leaves a tart, chalky aftertaste.',\n",
       " \"Pricy, but flashy, a Cabernet to pour into your best crystal stemware. It's elaborate in blackberry, cassis and oak flavors, with a tug of minerals. Seems too soft to develop in the bottle, so drink now and through 2014.\",\n",
       " \"So rich and concentrated, this blend of 97% Syrah and 3% Viognier is mind-blowing. It has massive flavors of blackberries, cherries, dark chocolate and spices. But it's not just the delicious factor that grabs you, it's how pure and balanced the tannins and acids are.\",\n",
       " \"Topel uses the Syrah Noir clone that was originally sourced from M. Chapoutier to make this tasty wine. It's packed with spicy red fruit and smooth, silky tannins. On the finish, it has a leathery tobacco note, with the richness of a cinnamon roll. Enjoy this with meaty dishes.\",\n",
       " 'This is three quarters Syrah, sourced from Klipsun, Hedges Bel Villa, and Lewis; with a touch of Merlot from the Meek vineyard. Dark, spicy and lush, its sappy fruit has a lively snap to it, with a hint of licorice and smoke. Not the funky “in the rocks” Walla Walla style of Syrah, this is for those who want the fruit forward, front and center.',\n",
       " \"This is a soft, simply constructed wine, but it's very tasty. Flatters the mouth with waves of ripe raspberries, cherries, currants and cocoa, sprinkled with anise and black pepper. Drink now.\",\n",
       " 'A very nice everyday red—dry, soft and warming. The blend is of at least eight varieties, and the flavors range from ripe cherries and raspberries to gingerbread, oatmeal cookies, peppermint pattie and licorice, with a finish of Asian spices.',\n",
       " \"An enormous Petite Sirah, sweetly rich and explosive. Shows very ripe, sugared blackberry, milk chocolate, beef jerky and black pepper flavors, wrapped into smooth tannins. Too soft to age, it's a wine to drink now.\",\n",
       " 'With 20% barrel fermentation, this wine is surprisingly rich and spicy for a low-end Chard. The aromas and flavors bring to mind pears and golden-delicious apples, before turning tart on the finish.',\n",
       " 'An impressive wine that presents a full bouquet with bready, leesy, toasty aromas, and intriguing lemon and caramel hints. The palate sports attractive fruit and spice flavors that are both complex and lovely, if a challenge to define. There’s a long full finish to this top-notch American sparkler.',\n",
       " \"The words “country style” apply perfectly to this Rhône blend based on Mourvèdre. It's soft and simple and dry, with pleasant cherry, blackberry and Kahlua flavors.\",\n",
       " \"I have not been impressed by this bottling in past vintages, but the '05 establishes a new benchmark. Just exactly why is hard to say. Yields were exceptionally low in this long, cool vintage, and lots of new French oak frames dramatically rich, ripe flavors of mashed cherries and raspberries, sprinkled with cinnamon, a drop of crème de cassis, and a pinch of white pepper. The depth and length are beautiful.\",\n",
       " 'Simple and rough in texture, with medicinal citrus fruit and dough flavors.',\n",
       " \"Whole berry fermentation and aging in neutral oak yield an aromatic, high-toned, fruity wine with a woody character—not new oak, but rather the flavor of neutral wood and gentle oxidation. The color of a Pinot Noir, it's drinking at its best now, with a mix of strawberry pastry and sour cherry candy.\",\n",
       " 'Slightly sweet and crisp, this blend of five varieties, mainly Sauvignon Blanc, has juicy flavors of apricots, grapefruits, oranges and spices. Nice with fruit, sushi, chicken enchiladas.',\n",
       " \"The Jack is Saviah's everyday successful red blend, and accounts for half of the winery's 7,000 case production. This is sweet and bursting with ripe red fruit flavors of strawberry preserves, raspberries and peaches. It hits some hard tannins but the pretty fruit keeps on going.\",\n",
       " 'An intricately layered nose of sagebrush, blood, pencil lead, soy, beef jerky, lilac, violet, lavender and tight cranberries shows on this stunning wine from the historic vineyard. The palate offers rounded red fruits and cherry tomatoes that tighten around a sagebrush core, bolstered by lots of oregano, black pepper, dried basil and eucalyptus.',\n",
       " 'Heavy and jammy for a rosé, with strong flavors of cherry, oranges and raspberries. Made from Cabernet Sauvignon and Nebbiolo.',\n",
       " \"A five-grape Bordeaux blend dominated by Merlot and Cab Franc, this is a deft mix of grapes nicely melded into a complete and satisfying wine. It's anchored by black cherry and cassis fruit, supple and focused. Surrounding that core fruit are layers of smoke, black olive, pencil lead and coffee grounds. It resonates gracefully through a long finish.\",\n",
       " 'A good follow-up to the 2005, though not as ripe and rich. The lemon-drop flavors are thinned out, and the 3% residual sugar is down by a full percentage point. This is firm, tangy and crisp, but does not have the concentration to carry it to the next level. It seems to hit a plateau and sit there through the finish.',\n",
       " \"Swan's longtime winemaker, Rod Berglund, turns his Pinot-esque hand to Gewürztraminer with this well-crafted, aromatic young white wine. Dry and crisply acidic, it shows intricate flavors of citrus, yellow apricot, lychee and honeysuckle flower, along with an enormous burst of dusty Asian spices.\",\n",
       " 'A spectacular Pinot that succeeds due to superior structure and complex flavors. With a silky texture, it feels smooth in the mouth, and shows dry, cool-climate flavors of raspberries, cola, oranges and anise, with the most lovely overlay of smoky oak. Beautiful acidity and finely meshed tannins provide the architecture. Drink now–2014.',\n",
       " \"Another huge '99. It is very dark and lavishly oaked, aged in 100% new French barrels. The immediate aroma is of vanilla and toast, while the palate experience is of oak and dry tannins that numb the palate through the finish. There is a core of blackberry fruit that is solid and dense, the result of very low yields. This pricy wine is not drinkable now, unless you're not fussy. If you buy it, plan on aging for at least five years.\",\n",
       " \"Rustic in texture, with jagged tannins, this is an old-fashioned wine, the kind they drank straight out of the cellar a long time ago. Made from Zinfandel, Carignan and several other varieties, it's dry and tannic, with berry, currant and spice flavors.\",\n",
       " \"Here's a clean, everyday Merlot that offers pleasure for its fruity flavors and dry finish. The blackberries, cherries, currants, blueberries, tobacco, herbs and spices are wrapped into a smooth texture.\",\n",
       " 'A funky undertone, similar to the Nicholas Estate bottling, weaves through the wine, along with a mix of cranberry, raspberry and sour cherry fruit. Despite the 14% alcohol, this wine seems light, delicate, the flavors pleasing but pale, and the finish a gentle fade.',\n",
       " 'The 2008 Pinots from Ken Wright display their individual terroirs quite succinctly, with little evidence of the (roughly) 30% new oak they receive. The Abbott Claim has a bit more of a chocolaty flavor, with full, spicy cherry fruit at its core. In fact there is so much fruit, spicy and candied, that it is a bit like fruitcake, in a good way.',\n",
       " \"Put enough sugar in anything and it tastes pretty good! So it is with this simple, fruity Port-style Zin. It's ripe in blackberry, chocolate and coffee flavors; overall it's very sweet.\",\n",
       " 'You have to classify this as a dry table wine, but it has enough residual sugar to qualify in the dessert category. With high, crisply clean acidity, it shows sugar-infused pineapple, pear, green apple and honeysuckle flavors.',\n",
       " \"Built like a Zinfandel, this hearty red wine is filled with wild berry, pepper and clove flavors, and is dry. It's a bit angular and harsh in tannins. Fine with barbecue and beef stew.\",\n",
       " \"The vineyard is noted for the quality of its Syrahs, and this one is right up there, although as currently constituted, it's a bit too young. Shows thick tannins and very ripe flavors of blackberry jam, cassis, cherry liqueur, melted dark chocolate, violets and a wonderful appliqué of cedar, finished with crunchy black pepper. Better by the winter of 2009, with slow-braised short ribs.\",\n",
       " \"Aggressive now in acidity, this Chardonnay has powerful sour Lifesaver candy flavors of pineapples and stony minerals, with a potent kick from smoky oak. It tastes young and jammy. It's elegant, and changes interestingly as it warms in the glass.\",\n",
       " 'Comes from a little-understood part of the sprawling Sonoma Coast, a place near San Pablo Bay yet to prove itself. There are ripe, rich, young vine flavors of cherry pie and cola, with a very sharp bite of tartness. Think of opulence versus acidity. Hard to tell which side wins. Drink now, for fresh, jammy fruitiness.',\n",
       " \"An extraordinary wine, although it's very young and thick now and needs time in the bottle. Totally dry, it shows elaborate flavors of cherries, raspberries, cocoa and sandalwood, with exotic notes of wild fennel, violets and nutmeg. Distinctive and compelling.\",\n",
       " \"The first of Morgan's '07 Pinots to be released, this is a full-bodied wine that needs some time in the bottle to mature. Not a lot, maybe a year or two, will allow the cherry, currant, mocha and cedar flavors to integrate with the oak and tannins.\",\n",
       " \"The vineyard is in the warmest corner of the valley, almost into Dry Creek, and the wine in its youth is a bit heavy. But it's quite rich and complex, showing flavors of currants, mocha, espresso, oranges, cola and peppery spice. Nice now, with a good steak, and could easily develop over the next 8 years.\",\n",

       " \"Savor this blend of Zin, Sangiovese and Petite Sirah with anything calling for an easy, full-bodied red wine. It's fruity and spicy, with berry-cherry flavors and a smooth, rich balance of acids and tannins.\",\n",
       " \"Here's a steely, minerally, sleek Chardonnay. Call it Cali-Chablis, if you will. That doesn't mean it's lean. Quite the opposite, it's an enormously complicated wine, with oak, lees and underlying peach custard and spicy mango cream flavors that finish long and dry. And what great acidity. Makes your mouth water. Chalk Hill is simply doing an amazing job lately, especially with Chardonnay.\",\n",
       " \"This big, massively ripe Pinot Noir needs time in the cellar to come around. Right now, it's all jammy cherry, raspberry and cola, accented with spicy, smoky sandalwood. The finish is thoroughly dry, and the tannin-acid balance is classic coastal, suggesting a wine that should develop at least through 2011. It's made from 30-year-old vines planted to the Martini clone.\",\n",
       " \"This is the least successful of De Loach's otherwise brilliant new range of Zinfandels, for one simple reason: it's overripe. The alcohol is an astounding 16.5%, and the wine has flavors of raisins and prunes.\",\n",
       " \"Spicy, with a big red-fruit expression, this is a yummy Barbera that's full of bright cherry juice. It's textured, layered and complex with a leathery finish. This wine is one to store for future enjoyment or to break open now with pasta now.\",\n",
       " \"I liked Morgan's Double L Chard for its Chablis-like character. This wine is more so. It's drier, more acidic and more elegant, but there's nothing lean about the power of its core of tropical fruit, which detonates on the palate and doesn't stop. There's fascination with every sip, as the wine slowly changes in the glass. This is a great wine and showcases the infinite possibilities of this appellation.\",\n",
       " \"This is a huge Cabernet, very soft in the modern manner, and very ripe. It's a blast of cherry jam and milk chocolate, with plenty of toasty oak, and the tannins are firm and complex. Good now, it should hold well for the next ten years.\",\n",
       " 'This 100% Cabernet Sauvignon is sweet and ripe in blackberry jam, cassis and smoky oak flavors. The structure is soft in acids and tannins. Lacks some dry complexity, but will dazzle fans of this rich, modern style.',\n",
       " \"This is an enormously rich, extracted wine, that's vast in cherries, blackberries, currants, chocolate and oak flavors. Yet it has balancing acidity and tannins. Best now and over the next few years, especially a great barbecued steak or leg of lamb.\",\n",
       " 'This unusual and distinctive Zin has a silky texture and rich, finely ground tannins. The flavors range from classic black and red currants, mulberries, cloves and pepper to pastry flavors of coconut macaroon and fig cookie. Could easily develop over a decade.',\n",
       " 'A brilliant white wine, very tart in acidity, with mineral flavors that make your mouth water. The flavors veer toward bright, tart citrus fruits, with suggestions of Chinese five-spice. The grapes were biodynamically farmed, which may partially be why the wine is so pure.',\n",
       " 'Pretty much Pinot Noir in name only. It has the silky texture and light tannins of the variety, with simple cherry, mint and pepper flavors.',\n",
       " \"Here's a gutsy, fruity Cabernet. It fills the mouth with juicy raspberry, cherry and blackberry flavors and hints of chocolate. Nothing subtle, just a dry, rich red wine for drinking now.\",\n",
       " 'Quite an attractive white wine, for its dryness, acidity and overall balance. Fills a real niche in giving us a citrusy, mineral-fresh wine with crisp acidity that will support, not compete with, foods ranging from grilled veggies and goat cheese to firm-fleshed white fish and poultry.',\n",
       " \"The vineyard has been the source of great Syrah, and while this is a good wine, it's not without flaws. Brilliantly ripe in black currants, cherries, cassis, chocolate, sweet leather and spices, it's dry and finely structured. But there's a scour of acid that disturbs its equilibrium.\",\n",
       " 'This soft and seductive wine is reminiscent of a good Chassagne-Montrachet from a relatively warm year. It has the same ripe, lightly tropical fruit, inflected with citrus and buoyed by firm acidity. The use of oak is restrained, the balance perfect, and the finish long and satisfying.',\n",
       " \"Tough in tannins, with a gritty mouthfeel, although it's also soft and jammy sweet. A blend of Syrah and Cabernet Sauvignon, this rustic wine is a little hot in alcohol. Drink now.\",\n",

       " \"This is bang-on clean and varietal Syrah, with a confident mix of sharp, toasty barrel flavors married to bright, acidic, berry-flavored fruit. Juicy and spicy, it's a great companion to the winery's Red Mountain Syrah, and shows the different character of the varied Washington terroir. It's just 14.2% alcohol, but it has a lot of power and kick to it.\",\n",
       " 'A near-perfect Albariño, bone dry, acidic and slightly green, with lime and mineral flavors. Totally cleanses the palate. A great cocktail sipper, or try with little Spanish-style tapas.',\n",
       " 'A good everyday Chardonnay that shows crisp acidity and the ultra-dryness and cleanliness of a well-made Central Coast Chard. Made for drinking now, with lime, white peach and mineral flavors.',\n",
       " 'Smoke and oak pronounce themselves vigorously on the nose and entry of this 100% varietal wine, which holds on with a tight grip. Black fruit dominates with leather, chocolate and tobacco playing secondary roles. The finish is lengthy and powerful.',\n",
       " \"Sometimes Franc can have a lovely, alluringly floral bouquet; other times it can be downright vegetal and display green-bean characteristics. Unfortunately, this is an example of the latter. The wine has nice weight and texture, so if you don't mind your veggies in liquid form this might be more to your liking.\",\n",
       " 'An unfortunate green, vegetal streak cuts through the heart of this Pinot Noir. It blurs the cherry fruit and detracts from the fine silky texture.',\n",

It's bone dry and elegantly crisp, with intricate flavors of cherries, rhubarb, pomegranates, Dr. Pepper cola and minerals, along with sweet, smoky notes from oak barrel aging. Best of all is the silky texture. Fine now, with decanting, and through 2014.\",\n",
       " 'This Bordeaux blend shows an interesting range of fruit flavors and textures from the blend, which includes Cabernet Sauvignon, Cabernet Franc, Petit Verdot and Merlot. The flavors tend toward red fruits, as in cherries and red currants, while the tannins are quite strong. Shows an immaturity now that strongly suggests 5–6 years in the cellar.',\n",
       " \"Cedar and tobacco on the nose, alongside some lovely floral notes. The most complex of Trinchero's Reserve offerings, this wine combines mint, flowers, cedar and cherries with a higher level of tannin than found in the winery's Cabernets.\",\n",
       " \"This is a big, ripe Zin from a great vineyard in a warm part of the appellation. There's a lot of heat, but it works well with the blackberry pie, cherry tart and milk chocolate flavors. Nice and dry, if a bit soft.\",\n",
       " \"So dry, so crisply acidic, so silky in the mouth, and so rich in flavor. This is a truly distinctive Pinot Noir. It shows the variety's elusive personality, now rich in cherries and currants, withdrawing into minerals and herbs. Yet the final impression is of fine, silky decadence. Should develop in fascinating directions over the next 6–8 years.\",\n",
       " 'Too ripe and obvious in fruit, with raisin, currant and black cherry jam flavors, accented with smoky, caramelized oak. Good and rich, but lacks subtlety. Drink now.',\n",
       " 'Heavy and dull, with medicinal flavors like cherry cough medicine.',\n",
       " 'Scents softly suggest rose petals and milk chocolate, leading into a wine that seems to hit a hard stop midpalate. A clear flavor of cold steel resonates against a counterpoint of tart berry fruit.',\n",
       " 'Announces itself with an unusual and pleasant Gewürtztraminer-like tangerine, lychee and ginger nose. Its mild but decidedly unique character is clearer on the melon, butter-cinnamon and peach palate. Nice acidity and a tangy-spicy finish.',\n",
       " 'This is 100% varietal, all stainless steel-fermented, and finished at a healthy 14.7% alcohol. The alcohol outstrips the fruit, which is light and generic. The dominant impression is alcoholic heat and some bitter phenolics.',\n",
       " \"Give this Pinot Noir some time to breathe and mellow in a decanter. Right out of the bottle, it's tough, tannic and jammy in raspberry and cherry flavors. But it doesn't take long for it to pick up some complexities. This wine's rich, sweet oakiness will pair well with steaks, lamb chops and mushroom risottos.\",\n",
       " \"A blend of eight varietals, kind of a Rhône-Bordeaux blend, this red shows a true Lodi typicity.

       " \"As its name states quite clearly, this is a plush, lush, smooth red wine. It's sweet and jammy like a shot of Jell-O.\",\n",
       " \"With more than 16% alcohol, this Zin has a hot mouthfeel, even for Dry Creek Zinfandel. Still, it's dry and smooth, with savory flavors of blackberry jam, chocolate, red and black currants, bacon and pepper. It's a good example of its type, and of Mazzocco's house style.\",\n",
       " \"Not a great success. It's sweet, but not enough to be satisfying given the flavors— citrus fruits edged with unripe vegetal.\",\n",
       " 'With a dusty core of black plum, cassis and clove, this is a straightforward, softly approachable wine made to be enjoyed now. Medium bodied, it enters into a realm of creamy vanilla on the finish.',\n",
       " 'A rich, layered Cabernet, with a deep core of blackberries, black currants and cedar, leading to a long, spicy finish. The key to understanding this wine is its tannins, which are hard and astringent. It may not have the inherent balance for cellaring. Probably best now, but could surprise.',\n",
       " 'The vintage was a very good one for Calera, offering the heat needed for ripeness but the cool nights for acidity. Mills is a ripe, delicious wine with blackberry, cherry, cola, mint and spice flavors resting on a complex, multi-layered palate that finishes firm and dry. Supple now, it should drink well for ten years.',\n",
       " \"Merryvale's Profile remains a star year after year. The '04 is nearly all Cabernet Sauvignon, and stuns with its power. With a smooth, complex tannin structure, it's rich in currants, blackberries and cedar, but is too young to open now. Should hit its stride around 2010 and continue to develop for some years after. Tasted twice, with consistent results.\",\n",
       " \"This is Talbott's minor bottling of Chardonnay, but it shows the house style. The 2010 vintage was fine, resulting in strong, forward apricot, tangerine, honey and oak flavors, made bold by Central Coast acidity.\",\n",
       " \"Sour and green, with minty, feline spray aromas and flavors. Despite some citrus notes, it's pretty lean.\",\n",
       " 'This new Malbec is a soft, fruity, extremely dark wine, with scents of raisins and pretty fruit flavors of boysenberries and black cherries, with lighter streaks of coffee and caramel woven through. The balance is excellent, though the wine does not show the depth of flavor that is expressed in its inky dark colors.',\n",
       " \"Sharp, zingy acidity marks this dry red wine. It's medium-bodied and silky, like a Pinot Noir, with rich cherry and oak flavors. Drink now.\",\n",
       " 'Appealing aromas of tobacco, smoke and spice herald the masculine edge to this red blend. Flavors of chocolate, smoke, spicebox and pepper are carried by a bright, red fruit wave. A touch tart on the finish but overall well rounded.',\n",
       " 'Despite ripe cherry, red licorice and cola flavors, this Pinot feels heavy and tannic in the mouth. It lacks the delicacy you want in the variety. It will age for many years, never quite shedding its rusticity.',\n",
       " 'Shows a welcome return to form for this bottling, after a few off years. The wine is wonderfully dry and complex, offering nuanced flavors of cherries, raspberries and cola, as well as the spicy, smoky sandalwood of oak barrel aging. A sophisticated and elegant wine for drinking now.',\n",
       " \"This 95% Cabernet Sauvignon perfectly captures the vineyard's strengths: lush, ripe, fleshy fruit that shows perfectly ripened flavors of cherry and cassis, bolstered by ripe, chewy tannins. It's substantial but not tiring; the balance of fruit, acid and tannins holds it together through a spicy, lingering finish. It's just a delicious wine, and one that should cellar well also.\",\n",
       " \"Tannic and astringent, this lacks the muscle and texture of the 2005. The fruit flavors center on hard raspberry candy, but it's very chalky and astringent through the finish.\",\n",
       " 'Very high alcohol in this superripe wine shows in a hot, chili pepper feeling and in the impression of sweetness. Both combine to give the berry-cherry flavors a rustic quality.',\n",
       " \"An o.k. everyday Cabernet. It's a little scoury in the mouth, with some green flavors alongside the sweet blackberries.\",\n",
       " \"Tastes just like a cherry coke, with the heat of alcohol and smoky spice of oak. That's a pleasant, even complex mélange of flavors, even though the structure is simple and direct.\",\n",
       " \"A difficult wine to evaluate, as it's young and unresolved. Has tobacco and mint aromas, with some cherries. Closed and on the palate shows some cassis and lots of oak. Tannins are big and astringent. Seems to lack fruit.\",\n",
       " 'Scents of sweet-cream butter, vanilla and stonefruit are enticing on the nose of this richly textured, medium-bodied wine. The palate boasts hints of sweet lemon curd and fresh apple, but the slightly-sour oak notes can be overwhelming.',\n",
       " 'An enormously opulent wine, brimming with gobs of red cherries, currants, mocha, clove, cinnamon and pepper flavors. Impresses for the lushness and integrity of the structure. Brilliant wine, just gorgeous, a real crowd-pleaser. With its recent track record, Kynsi enters the front ranks of California Pinot Noir producers.',\n",
       " \"Sugary, like pineapple and lemon jam melted down into wine. Yet it's clean and zesty in acidity. If you like a sweet white, it's all yours.\",\n",
       " \"A worthy followup to the '05, possibly even richer and more balanced. Shows wonderfully crisp, mouthwatering acidity framing fruit that's so pure, it's like the essence of pineapples, mangoes, limes and green apples. Lots of oak is here, too, and the smoky, spicy vanillins add just the right touch.\",\n",
       " 'Formerly the popular Three Vineyards bottling, this has been re-named, but remains the same friendly Merlot-dominated Bordeaux blend, with just a bit of Syrah adding spice. Smooth and silky in the mouth, it mixes red and blue fruits, with a ripe, round midpalate and light chocolate and toasted nuts to finish.',\n",
       " \"Lots of acidity in this dry, light-bodied Pinot Noir. It's a good wine to drink now, with pretty flavors of cola, raspberries, honey-baked ham and pepper.\",\n",
       " \"This pink stands out for its Ruby Red grapefruit aromas, backed by touches of orange peel and chalk. The mouthfeel is grippy and energetic, recalling again a grapefruit's juice and pith. A perfect breakfast wine.\",\n",
       " 'This wine is made from a majority of Cabernet Sauvignon, with tiny additions of Merlot, Malbec and Petit Verdot. A minty, menthol streak is strong on the nose, veering into almost eucalyptus, while dried herb and a shot of gunpowder provide additional savory aromas and flavors. Big tannins need time in the glass to mellow.',\n",

       " 'Pure Syrah from the oldest planting in the state (at Red Willow). At first the barrel spices, notably cumin, dominate; but with some hours of breathing time a core of brambly fruit, accented with roasted earth, comes into play. An elegant and polished wine, it has the structure to age for at least a half decade longer.',\n",
       " \"A very nice Cab, dry and tannic, and not too fruity. Shows subtle cherry and herb flavors that turn licoricey. With low alcohol, it's a stylish, elegant wine.\",\n",

       " 'This is rich and dry in blackberries, licorice, bacon, sweet oak and peppery spices. It shows lots of acidity and tannins, giving it a firm structure. Give it a brief decant and drink now.',\n",
       " 'A full-bodied blend of 66% Mourvèdre, 30% Grenache and 4% Syrah bled off like a rosé and then fermented like a white wine, very reminiscent of a rosé from Provence. Dry, with prevailing flavors of strawberry and sweet spice, this Vin Gris is both pleasant enough to sip as an apéritif and bold enough to stand next to a range of food, seafood in particular.',\n",
       " 'A brilliant Chardonnay, displaying both the terroir of this fine upland part of Monterey County, and the cool vintage that let the grapes hang on the vines until they were perfectly ripe. Dazzles with pineapple and mango fruit, with a perfect jacket of sweet, vanilla-scented oak. Best of all is the acidity, which is brisk, bright and clean.',\n",
       " 'This is a big, sweet, extracted wine, for those who like Chardonnay packed with fruit. It tastes like buttered popcorn, orange jam, gingerbread and vanilla caramel.',\n",

       " 'This is crystal clear, fleshy and ripe, yet still graceful and refined. Mixed stone fruits are cut with yellow apple, the acids are natural and perfectly integrated. The wine was barrel fermented in a 50/50 mix of new and neutral, and there is just a hint of caramel in the extended finish.',\n",
       " 'Tart and dry, this has a broad flavor that does not express much varietal specificity, with some notes of caramel and butter. Not yet knit together, this could improve significantly with further bottle age.',\n",
       " \"You would be hard-pressed to guess the varietal in a blind tasting—it's generic red, almost 15% alcohol, cherry fruit, astringent tannins, some black olive and licorice. Quite drinkable but nondescript.\",\n",
       " 'Bone dry, and brightened with zesty acidity, this fabulous SB defines the category. Accented with a touch of oak, it stars potent citrus and tropical fruit, green apple, white flower and mineral flavors, with a complexity that makes it easily worth the price.

       " \"It's said that Dick Arrowood personally checks every bottle that goes out—his attention to detail shows here. A complex and refined bouquet of toasted oat, coconut, orange and peach opens to a full palate of apple, yellow plum and caramel flavors.

There is an unusual minty spice underlying the cassis and cherry fruit, and it provides a nice line for the flavors as they weave across the palate.

Thick and tannic, yet perfectly ripe and almost silky, it coats the palate with black cherry, graphite, slate and a bit of chalk. All that said, the fruit more than holds its own against the terroir's minerality. Drink this with your best steak, and give it plenty of breathing time.\",\n",
       " 'Frankly sweet, this Riesling, made only from cool coastal grapes, benefits from crisp acidity. The tartness balances the sugary peach, citrus and honeysuckle flavors.',\n",
       " 'A unique balance—9.8% alcohol and 2% residual sugar—with the subtle flavors of old vines a bonus. A gorgeous wine, tasted with escalar (white tuna) served as sushi. The buttery fish and the light, elegant Riesling are a stunning match. Neither overtakes the other.',\n",

The palate's understated nectarine, pear, pineapple flavors are bolstered by firm but not sharp acidity. The mouthfeel is crisp; the wine's fine structure shows through the tangy, nut-pepper finish. Already impressive, but warrants cellaring for two or three years. Top Value.\",\n",

It displays both smoky toast and bright orange-lemon notes on the finish.',\n",
       " \"There's a good crunch of mouthwatering acidity on this wine, like biting into a green apple or slice of pineapple, both of whose flavors are here, along with gooseberries and a distinct taste of nutmeg. The wine is very dry. Creaminess adds needed richness, but it's still a tart wine.\",\n",
       " \"This barrel-fermented Chardonnay shows smoky new oak and telltale matchstick leesy aromas. Real spiciness comes through on the palate.

These are still young vines, and though the potential for greatness is there, they don't deliver the complexity of their neighbor Ciel du Cheval—yet. Excellent fruit mixes berries and cherries, while barrel aging shows in the accents of spice and cracker. Medium-bodied, with alcohol approaching 15%.\",\n",
       " \"Kind of clunky now. Bigtime tannins make it astringent, and the fruit flavors, of blackberries and sour cherry candy coated with oak, feel ripely heavy on the palate. Yet it's a clean wine, and could surprise down the road. Try after 2012.\",\n",
       " \"The sweetness got out of hand in this wine, which tastes like it has excessive residual sugar. There's a raspberry and white chocolate power bar flavor. That's delicious, of course, but consumers should know the wine isn't dry.\",\n",

       " \"Here's a big, ripe, juicy Zin that's rustic and a little sweet but enjoyable for its purity. Has powerful flavors of raspberry and cherry purée, with a streak of cocoa and peppery spices. It's lighter in body than others, and not very tannic. It packs a punch of acidity.\",\n",
       " 'So softly delicious, so complex and sensually satisfying, this Bordeaux blend, which is based on Cabernet Sauvignon and contains all the other classic varieties, is truly a wine to savor. The blackberry and cassis flavors have an edge of chocolate, and the deliciousness is compounded by superbly ripe, sculpted tannins and a long but thoroughly dryfinish. Dazzlingly good, and could develop bottle complexity over the years.',\n",

The tart, tangy fruit suggests cranberries and plums; it's a light purple, beautifully clear and brilliant wine, a pleasure to look at as well as to savor. As before, it shows tremendous definition and balance; it's beautifully structured, transparent and concentrated.\",\n",

As young as it is, it hits a bit of a dead spot in the back, but it has the stuffing (and the pedigree) that would suggest that with a few years of cellaring it will open out and show more of the herb and smoked meat character that is lurking just below the surface.\",\n",

Smooth, supple and long, with uncommon purity, it finishes with a kiss of chocolate from 18 months in one-quarter new oak barrels.',\n",
       " 'Continues the solid trend of this label producing some of the best values in California. Dry, crisp and delicious, with mineral-infused flavors of oranges, honeysuckle and buttered toast. A blend of Malvasia Bianca, Muscat Canelli, Viognier and Roussanne. Best Buy.',\n",
       " 'This Cab Franc-Merlot blend is beautifully aromatic, with sappy fruit flavors in a clearly identifiable Cayuse style. Rich strawberry-inflected fruit, sour cherry (griotte), dried herbs and a lightly salty texture infuse a wine that also packs in plenty of the earthy, compost character of Cayuse. Tannins are already beginning to age into a finish with black tea highlights.',\n",
       " \"There's plenty of toast for the new-oakies, but it's wrapped around lovely raspberry and plum fruit. Light notes of mint and leather add interest; the wine resonates nicely and gently fades rather than falling off a cliff. Not as massively ripe as the 2003, but equally fine.\",\n",
       " 'From the oldest block of the estate vineyard, this fruit-driven Pinot is crisp and lively, mixing bright berry flavors with just a hint of sandalwood. Tannins are tamed, and the emphasis is clearly on purity of fruit.',\n",
       " 'Made from single (777) clone, organically-grown grapes, the Blackjack Block Pinot Noir is focused and complex. The mid-palate shows flesh and fat, ripe berry and cherry fruit, with a backing of citrusy acids. Its middle is its strength; it would benefit from blending to add more depth to both front and back.',\n",
       " 'This is a simple wine, with orange, lime and vanilla flavors. Despite brisk acidity, it quickly turns cloying.',\n",
       " \"A lovely, softly dry wine to drink now with everything from Mexican to barbecue. Made from Cabernet Sauvignon, Petite Sirah and Syrah, it's dry and rich in berry, cherry and currant flavors, with an edge of unsweetened chocolate and Indian spices. Good price for the quality.\",\n",
       " 'A very fine Pinot Noir that shows the crispness of its Central Coast origins, and also plenty of richness. Offers waves of cherries, red currants, cola and cedar, with a pleasantly stimulating bitterness. Drink this complex, food-friendly wine now and through 2011.',\n",
       " \"This area of central Rutherford is far better known for Cabernet. Sauvignon Blanc is rare. This is a pretty good one. Not great, because it's compromised by some unripe, green, stalky flavors. But it's very dry and crisp, and you'll find enough lemons and limes to satisfy.\",\n",
       " 'Robust and deeply flavored in wild berry, tobacco, smoked meat and spice flavors. A somewhat rustic wine that needs big, rich roasts and barbecue.',\n",
       " 'Too soft and sweet, like melted raspberry jam. Feels tired and syrupy.',\n",
       " \"Let the conversations about minerality begin. Whatever it is, or wherever it comes from, it's here big time, adding a lick of steel and a metallic mouthfeel to the underlying fruit.

This bone dry, crisp Chardonnay is a game changer that will make you look at California Chardonnay differently.\",\n",
       " 'Soft, decadent and approachable, this Cabernet Sauvignon is blended with a little Malbec. It offers flavors of blackberry jam, black currant, dark chocolate and cedar that continue on the long, spicy finish. This is lovely to drink now and over the next five years.',\n",
       " \"Quite tart as you'd expect from a coastal vineyard in this region, with acid-inspired long hangtime flavors of cherries and raspberries, accented with smoky oak. Tastes a tad sweet and fruit-bomby at the age of three years.\",\n",
       " 'All estate-grown fruit, blended with 11% Merlot, which seems to soften up the tannins a bit. This is aromatic and complex, weaving together scents of cassis, licorice, tobacco and smoke. Flavors follow, with plenty of black cherry fruit in the concentrated core.',\n",
       " \"This Bordeaux-style blend is complex, mingling cherry, blackberry and cassis fruit with notes of violets, dried spices and black olives. It's full-bodied and supple, with rich, fine tannins that taper off gently on the finish. Drink now–2015.\",\n",
       " 'This is firm and well-oaked, with the customary high alcohol levels that Spring Valley has been able to manage so well in the past. But at 15+% one expects to find commensurate weight and density; this feels like a much lighter wine, as far as the fruit concentration is concerned. The tannins are still a bit rough and slightly bitter, and the cherry fruit flavors not quite up to carrying all that new oak.',\n",

       " 'Ripe and deep in berry, currant, cassis and spice flavors, with a rich overlay of cedary oak. Shows some roughness in midpalate and tannic astringency on the finish. Good, but edgy and a little harsh. Contains some Petite Sirah and Syrah.',\n",
       " 'Displaying great fruit and excellent structure, this can be enjoyed now, but it has soon scale and intensity that we suggest aging it for at least another year or two. Barelli seems to yield darkly-fruited wines of depth and structure that read somewhat tighter and harder in their youth. Has classic cassis, toasty oak and tobacco touches, plus a dusty Alexander Valley feel.',\n",
       " \"A gutsy, muscular Barbera with deep, dark flavors of chocolate, blackberries, black currants, sweet leather and spices. It shows Barbera's typical acidity and tannins, and is bone dry. This is one of the better ones out there.\",\n",

       " 'This wine is quite dry, with a good grip of dusty tannins and a silky mouthfeel. It has cherry-berry and cocoa flavors and a long, fruity finish. Drinking well now, it should be consumed in the next year to preserve vibrancy.',\n",
       " \"Two characteristics make this wine outstanding. One is the sheer richness of flavor—waves of raspberries, cherries, chocolate, bacon and sandalwood that flood the palate.

       " \"American and Hungarian oak barrels were used, adding a rustic, powerful base to this pure Primitivo. Think Zinfandel crossed with Lemberger and you're in the ballpark of its style. Its raw, big-boned flavors of fruit and barrel are ready for a juicy steak.\",\n",
       " \"Very ripe and exotically delicious, with extravagant flavors of red cherry pie filling, raspberry caramel, vanilla custard and smoky oak flavors that are as rich as a pastry dessert. Fortunately, the wine is thoroughly dry. But it's hot in alcohol, and too soft to age, so drink now.\",\n",
       " \"This is a Merlot, Cab Sauvignon and Cab Franc blend. It's fairly soft and approachable, with cherry fruit under green tannins. It opens with a pleasant fruitiness, then quickly fades.\",\n",

       " \"Notes of honeysuckle, white peach and fresh green herb are intensely aromatic. This off-dry effort balances zippy, lemon-lime acidity with layers of ripe, rich fruit. It's lushly textured, yet it finishes delicately with a bristle of white-tea astringency.\",\n",
       " \"A beautiful young Rutherford Cabernet, showing the dusty elegance and complexity of a top estate. There's a rich herbality to the cherry, cassis and blackberry fruit, suggesting fresh green chervil, sage and thyme. Oak adds harmonious notes of vanilla, cedar and char. The tannins are thick and juvenile, but very finely ground. With 8% Cabernet Franc, this lush wine needs time. Hold until after 2008, and it should improve for another six years, conservatively.\",\n",

The fragrant, evocative results showcase the fruit but also buttress it with properly managed acids, tannins and new oak.\",\n",
       " 'Full-bodied, it leans into stone fruits and light tropical. Tasted a few weeks before its official release, it remained a little sugary, with its relatively high alcohol (and lower acidity) adding to the impression of sweetness.',\n",

       " \"A Pinot-Syrah-Merlot blend that doesn't really go anywhere. It's stiff and herbal, stemmy and tannic, with no resolution of the various varietal fruit flavors. Red, tart and tannic.\",\n",
       " \"This is one of those wines that taste sweet and dry at the same time. There's superripe orange and pineapple marmalade fruit, but then clean acidity and a stony minerality wash over the palate, making the finish dry. It's an interesting blend of Roussanne, Grenache Blanc and Viognier.\",\n",
       " \"A classy Cabernet, this wine shows the potential of this emerging San Benito County appellation. It's dry and smooth, with firm but supple tannins that provide grip to the blackberry, cherry and black currant flavors.\",\n",
       " 'Shows the soft tannins and slight herbal quality of a top Alexander Valley Cab, along with low-yield mountain concentration of red and black currants, mocha and spice. Drink this polished, supple wine through 2012.',\n",
       " \"Shows the clear, fine color, silky mouthfeel and crisp acidity that characterize a fine, cool-climate Pinot Noir, but I wish the fruit were a little more concentrated. It's fine in cola, red cherry, pomegranate and rhubarb, but the middle is thin and the finish is quick. Drink now.\",\n",
       " 'Fans of powerful, fruit-driven Zinfandel will exult in this monster of a wine. It is an explosion of blueberry, raspberry, plum, blackberry, chocolate-covered raisin and sandalwood flavors. This is tannic, and the high alcohol gives it a glycerine-driven sweetness.',\n",
       " \"Lots of acidity in this very dry, somewhat austere young Pinot Noir. That sharp bite is relieved by fruity flavors of raspberries, cherries and cola, not to mention sweet oak. Give it a good decant, but it's always going to be tart.\",\n",
       " \"Very rich and extracted, and much more full-bodied than Sausal's “Family” Zin, with which it was co-released. This is one to cellar for a few years, to let things come together. Just massive in chocolate, berry jam and pepper spices, wrapped into firm, refined tannins.\",\n",
       " \"There is a ton of black pepper flavor in this stylish blend of Cabernet Sauvignon, Sangiovese, Merlot and Syrah. It also bears notes of licorice, sweet red currants, grilled prosciutto and sandalwood. This tastes so rich that it almost seems sweet, but it's actually dry and balanced.\",\n",
       " \"Here's a country-style wine, rough and ready for consumption. It's rugged in texture, with jagged tannins framing superripe berry flavors leading to a finish that's almost sweet in raisins.\",\n",
       " 'This is hefty, dry and structured Chardonnay. Offers a complex musky, creamy nose that ushers in a range of tart citrus, coconut, toasted nut and mineral flavors. The smoky finish also shows a crisp, almost hard-edged metallic note. Stylized and appealing, but still tight—should be better in a year or two.',\n",

       " 'Made like an old-fashioned Barbera, this one is truculent in tannins, with a full-bodied mouthfeel housing flavors of blackberries, currants, leather, anise and pepper. It will probably live for two decades, gradually sweetening as it throws sediment, but always remaining rustic.',\n",
       " 'Unbalanced, with weedy, grassy flavors side by side with sweet spearmint chewing gum and pineapple LifeSaver candy. Crisp acidity gives it the sweet-sour taste of certain Chinese sauces.',\n",

Just overpowers the palate with cassis, licorice, leather and dark unsweetened, slightly bitter baker's chocolate, with a potent dose of freshly crushed pepper. So impressive, the perfect expression of great terroir in a great, cool vintage. But it's very tannic. Drink now through 2013.\",\n",
       " \"This is an extraordinarily rich Zinfandel. It explodes in jammy blackberries, blueberries and cherries, with cola, mocha, currant, smoked meat and black pepper complexities. Could be a bit firmer in acidity, with greater structure, but it's nice and dry. Drink now for fruity exuberance.\",\n",
       " \"A wonderful blush wine that does what rosé is supposed to do. Stimulates the palate with mouthwateringly crisp citrus, red cherry, raspberry, vanilla and spice flavors. So easy to drink, it's one of the better rosés out there.\",\n",
       " 'Intense, alcoholic, and wonderfully complex, with layers of toast, spice and fruit. The vines range from 50 to 80 years old or more; the wine is robust, balanced and muscular. St. Francis makes a flat-out wonderful Zin year after year, vintage after vintage, big and bellisimo.',\n",

The vintage was California's finest ever, and the wine shows spectacularly ripe red currant, cherry, tangerine zest, licorice and beef jerky flavors, with just the right touch of smoky oak. Yet the structural balance of acidity and fine tannins gives it the perfect architecture. Best now in its flashy youth and for the next 4 or 5 years.\",\n",
       " \"This vineyard-designated wine includes 13% Cabernet Sauvignon and 9% Syrah. The Syrah component seems to take over, in the form of tart berry, herb and dried leaf flavors.

       " 'Entirely off the estate, this polished young Pinot offers a complex mélange of flavors, in a balanced structure. The tastes of root beer, red currants, licorice, gingersnap cookie and sweet oak are frankly delicious. Fine now, and should peak by 2010, then hold for several more years.',\n",
       " \"This is a big, ripe, full-bodied and oaky Pinot Noir. It's too powerful to drink now, unless you don't mind immaturity.

       " 'This Cabernet-Syrah blend is made in a lighter, more acidic and earthier style than most red wines these days. With only 13.9% alcohol, it shows crisp flavors of dried cherries, tobacco, black pepper and sandalwood. Needs a good decant.',\n",

       " \"California rosé is awfully hard to get right. It's usually too sweet, too heavy or both. With this Grenache-Cinsault blend, Minassian-Young knocks it out of the park. The wine is dry, delicate, modest in alcohol, and complex, with subtle peach, rosehip tea, orange zest, watermelon and spice flavors. A great bargain, but only 64 cases were produced.\",\n",
       " \"Honeyed layers of yellow peach and tangerine seem to be dusted by bramble and mineral tones in this semisweet Riesling. It's a spry, zesty wine with a lip-smacking, juicy finish. Drink now through 2019.\",\n",
       " 'Very plush and lush, offering deep, ripe flavors of blackberries, currants, cassis, violets, herbs and smoky cedar, wrapped into firm tannins. Should develop gracefully over the next 8–10 years. The wine is a Bordeaux blend with a splash of Syrah, which seems to add a meaty note.',\n",
       " 'A rustic Merlot. The cherry, cassis and chocolate fruit flavors are so powerful, they swamp the wine, leaving elegance behind and making it indelicate.',\n",
       " 'A field blend of 85% Zinfandel, 11% Alicante Bouschet and 4% Petite Sirah, this juicy, spicy wine is robust and full bodied. Blackberry syrup and black cherry combine around cinnamon and black pepper, finishing in a wave of power.',\n",
       " 'Shows the distinctive crushed pepper aroma of a fine Northern Rhône Syrah, although the wine is much softer than anything from that region. The softness makes it gentle and easy to enjoy now, with its delicious flavors of blackberries, cherries, black raspberries, plums and milk chocolate.',\n",
       " 'A modern style coastal Chardonnay, brimming with acidity and starring major league pineapple, tangerine, Asian pear, buttered toast and honey vanilla flavors. Very rich and flamboyant. Calls for a rich shellfish dish in a cream sauce.',\n",
       " 'This large vineyard, in the hills of eastern Napa, is source to many wineries, and now Surh Luchel dips into the pot. This is a very good wine, dry and classically structured, with thick but finely ground tannins and ripe flavors of black currants and new French oak. A touch of asperity in the finish warrants against aging.',\n",
       " \"One of the world's most ambitious projects, this island-grown wine is starting to shine, with aromas of orange blossom, toasted Marcona almonds, walnut oil, marzipan and smoky flint. Those slightly oxidized notes are cut on the palate by lots of fresh lime juice and ruby-red grapefruit juice that shows alongside riper lemon cake flavors.\",\n",
       " 'This is 62% Cabernet Sauvignon and 38% Syrah. The Cab shines here, firm and confident, with sharp edges from spicy herbs. The fruit is polished and silky, and the wine seems to have a sheen over it, an almost gauze-like surface that shimmers and shines.',\n",
       " 'Somewhat sharp and tartly aggressive now in jammy fruit, with raspberry, cherry, wintergreen mint and cola flavors, sweetened with smoky wood notes. Doe not seem like an ager, so drink now with very rich meats, oils and cheeses to soften the hardness.',\n",

       " 'A rich, woody style of Pinot Blanc, the barrel toast wrapped around superripe tropical fruit flavors of banana, papaya and pineapple, with a hint of grapefruity acids. This is flat-out delicious, and could easily pass for an expensive Chardonnay.',\n",
       " \"Here's a big, gutsy Syrah that's ripe in blackberries, but also a little ungainly. There are some raisiny flavors as well as minty ones, giving it the taste of a Chinese sweet and sour cherry sauce.\",\n",
       " \"This is the first Col Solare release to bear the Red Mountain appellation. It's a limited-production wine made from Klipsun, Kiona and estate-grown grapes. It feels tight, and it shows great depth of fruit, along with pencil lead, oreo cookie and smoke notes.\",\n",
       " 'Young, fragrant, and loaded with milk chocolate and spicy berry. Tight, tannic, with grip and tang; pleasingly moderate, listed under 14% alcohol. Although this has no Grenache in it, it has that sort of tart berry quality, with stiffer tannins.',\n",
       " \"This is the first time that Sineann has offered a reserve bottling of this wine, which does step it up even further than the “regular” Baby Poux.

       " \"So ripe and fruity, it's almost too much of a good thing. Detonates on the palate with blasts of blackberries, cherries, raspberries, cola and cinnamon spice. Feels too soft, and could use greater dryness and structure, but it's a good BBQ sipper.\",\n",
       " \"Salmon pink in color, this starts with a burst of raspberry cream and vanilla aromas, and turns rich and creamy on the palate. Has pretty fruit flavors of raspberries and strawberries, it's drier than you expect, more fruity than sweet. Closes with an ultraclean finish.\",\n",

       " \"With 12 months in French oak, the Reserve Barrel Fermented Chardonnay is a rounder, more spice-infused Chard than Macari's regular Estate Bottled offering.

       " \"This will be the last Klipsun wine from Andrew Will. It's 60% Merlot and 40% Cabernet Sauvignon, and as usual with Klipsun fruit it's a big, chewy wine, though a bit monolithic. Ripe, tight and hard, it's packed with black fruits and flavors of black tea, smoke and chalk.\",\n",
       " \"This winery's style always has been to produce food-friendly wines, and this one certainly is. Sommeliers might want to check it out as an interesting alternative to Zinfandel.

       " 'This lush, intricate and complex Pinot Noir really brings out the best of Russian River Valley. The fruit is enormously ripe, suggesting mashed cherries, blackberry jam, red licorice, cola and peppery spices, and the tannin-acid structure is just about perfect.

       " 'Aromas and flavors of sandalwood and grenadine layer around this velvety, seductive wine. It offers black tea, truffle and forest floor, the body sinewy and complex. Savory in cinnamon and clove on the finish, it needs more time to open; decant or cellar through 2021.',\n",
       " 'A beautiful Cabernet, dry, smoothly tannic and impressive for its volume of flavor. Shows a complex range of blackberries, black currants, minerals and oak, with a long, spicy finish. Elegant and powerful at the same time, it should develop in the bottle over the next decade.',\n",
       " 'Lots of briary wild blackberry, cherry and exotic spice flavors in this Zin, with cola, tobacco and mushu plum sauce complexities, and the finish is dry. Compromised by a hit of sharp acidity, but rich barbecue will help.',\n",

       " \"The Jerome represents the winery's selection of what it considers its best barrels. For me, it falls just a bit short of the single-vineyard bottlings in this hot, ripe year. Delicious to be sure, it's got plenty of sweet, jammy raspberry and cherry fruit, and tell-tale vanilla from new oak barrels. Big, forward and tannic.\",\n",
       " \"The really ripe dark cherry, toasty oak and licorice aromas and flavors here are winning. It has a wonderful sweetness and balance. The fruit here is rounder and more forward than in the Barelli—still, it's big, juicy and has plenty of structure.\",\n",
       " 'The Derby is pure, estate-grown, 100% Cabernet Sauvignon. The nose is accented with hints of violets and roses, ripe berries, plums and licorice. Once tasted, it seems to hit a wall and just stop. Extra hours of breathing did not make a difference. Perhaps it needs more bottle age, but at the moment it does not broaden out or move into a finish with the sort of depth that this wine has demonstrated in the past.',\n",
       " 'This vineyard designate from Chelle den Millie is spicy and tart. There is medium concentration to the fruit, a mix of cassis and black cherry. The overall potency is heightened by strong scents of herbal spice and grippy tannins, ripe but still showing some of the varietal leaf and moist earth flavors.',\n",
       " 'Well made, this is a sappy, snappy take on Syrah, with vivid wild berry fruit and lively acids. It snaps into focus right away, then slowly softens as it weaves through the palate, with mixed berries, rhubarb, plum and hints of citrus. The finish lasts a full minute, adding notes of black pepper as it fades. This is beautifully rendered and not overblown in any way, with the alcohol at just 13.5%.',\n",
       " \"Sweet and simple, this wine has a pretty nose that offers body and a delicate, dancing set of aromas all at once. On the palate, it's a burst of flowers and honey. May be too precious for fans of drier whites, but overall, well made and fun to drink.\",\n",
       " 'Right now this wine is strutting its stuff, showing dense, fudge-like scents of tobacco, cassis and whiffs of vanilla and coconut and flavors of blackberry with lashings of vanilla and cocoa. But like many vintages of Montelena, expect this one to shut down in another year only to reemerge as a beauty around age 10 or 12. Another classic.',\n",
       " 'A beautiful Cabernet, well structured, dry and rich. It feels soft and inviting in the mouth, with waves of ripe blackberries and cassis, and the fine tannins that accompany a good mountain red wine. Contains some Cabernet Franc, which adds cherry richness. Drink now for maximum freshness.',\n",
       " \"This vineyard has been Demeter certified biodynamic, one of just a handful in Washington to achieve that recognition. It's all natural, ripe and full-flavored, with a wonderful, mouthfilling intensity. The flavors are a lovely mix of stone, yeast, flower and a jumble of citrus and apple fruits.\",\n",
       " 'Tastes sweet and honeyed in pineapple and lemon Lifesaver candy, with a sharp cut of acidity that tastes almost unnatural. Feels overly manipulated, but will appeal to lots of people.',\n",
       " 'The first thing you notice is the complexity of flavor, carrying waves of wild forest raspberries and cherries, framboise and other liqueury, extracted tastes, sprinkled with rose petal, Dr. Pepper cola and exotic spices, and rounded off with smoky sandalwood. Then the tannins and acids kick in, emphasizing extreme dryness. There are dozens of Pinot Noirs that are more drinkable now, but this is such an interesting interpretation that it deserves a place in your cellar. Try after 2013.',\n",
       " \"A beautiful southern Rhône-style wine, based on Syrah but with additions of Mourvèdre and Grenache. It's dry, fulled-bodied and tannic, with meaty, leathery flavors of blackberries and cassis. Feels very rich and dense, and should develop for the next 4–5 years.\",\n",
       " 'This feels a bit stripped, though the bottle says the alcohol hits almost 15%. There is a chocolaty coating over sharp, herbal, rather thin fruit flavors. The wine shows pleasant strawberry and watermelon fruit flavors, though the tannins and chocolaty barrel flavors quickly take over.',\n",
       " 'Ed Sbragia loves new oak, and this one has 100% of it, which makes it toasty and woody. The underlying wine is dry and crisp, with peach, apple and pear flavors, but the oak is very heavy, leading to a crème brûlée finish without the sweetness.',\n",
       " \"A bit tough and gritty, with a less-than-ripe green tomato flavor alongside the notes of cherry and pomegranate. Oaky richness adds sweetness and texture to this wine. It's not going anywhere, but the acid-tannin structure and minerality are pleasurable. Give it a decant and enjoy.\",\n",
       " \"Maybe a cigar will improve this Zin. It's hot and soft, with unbalanced, sweet cherry-jelly and green-mint flavors, and the sweetness makes the tannins astringent.\",\n",
       " 'This is a very late release for this 2007 Merlot, and the wine is well on its way to full maturity. Smooth and supple, its fruit is drying out, showing cherry-flavored fruit leather as the main component. Streaks of coffee and tobacco fill in the finish.',\n",
       " 'Mostly Pinot Blanc, this is an excellent bottle, succulent and juicy, just 12.6% alcohol, which puts it in the European camp. Mouthfilling citrus mixing lime, lemon, pineapple, orange and a bit of candied apricot all contribute to this tasty wine.',\n",
       " 'Limited production, estate grown, with alcohol listed at just under 15%. Despite the sugar ripeness, the wine seems overwhelmed by flavors of new oak barrels. Dusty, smoky, toasty and streaked with caramel, it suggests tart red fruit lies below. Tasty, but probably best to drink now.',\n",
       " \"Frankly sweet, with honeyed flavors of raspberries, vanilla and crunchy granola. Finishes clean and zesty in acidity. If this is your style, it's a great buy.\",\n",
       " \"California's top Sauvignon Blanc specialist continues on a roll with this wonderfully pure, clean wine. It's crisp and bone dry in gooseberry, lemon and lime and fig flavors, with an intense cassis or blackcurrant flavor that's unusual and thrilling in a dry Sauvignon Blanc. You'll savor every sip of this exceptional wine.\",\n",
       " \"A blend of Napa Valley, Lake County and Lodi, this is a somewhat rustic wine, with a minty green, briary edge to the cherry fruit. It's astringently tannic, but appeals for its dry balance.\",\n",
       " \"Give this young Cabernet a good decant before you serve, because it's a big, brooding wine that needs some air to open up. Right out of the bottle, it's tannic and dry, and the blackberry and black currant flavors are buried under a blanket of astringency. But it's quite a good, well-made wine.\",\n",
       " 'Heavy clove and cinnamon-spice notes grace the nose of this very limited single-vineyard offering. Honey, stone and a nuttiness mark the nose. Ripe and lively pineapple, banana, lime and grapefruit flavors shine nicely in a medium-weight, well-balanced style. Finishes long and tart. A year or two in the bottle will bring out more complexity.',\n",
       " 'A dusty, cigar-smoke character on the nose of this blend of 52% Syrah and 48% Cabernet Sauvignon spices up aromas of strawberry fruit and rotting roses. The palate combines complex cranberry fruits with Kalamata olive, thyme and pencil lead.',\n",
       " 'With mostly Chardonnay and a little of the Symphony grape, this is a fruity, deliciously gulpable wine showing intense peach, pear, apple and vanilla-cinnamon flavors.',\n",
       " 'A good, complex wine, but the oak currently sticks out, swamping the fruit with caramel. Makes you wonder why the winemaker thought all that wood was needed, for the underlying blackberry and black cherry fruit flavors are wonderful. Sometimes, less is more.',\n",
       " \"This is a bright fruit-driven wine, with clean and refreshing flavors. All stainless fermented, it's got a sharp, tangy finish, that will cut through rich creamy sauces.\",\n",
       " \"Lots of creamy milk chocolate, raspberry, cherry and cassis flavors in this wine,but with 16.2% alcohol, it's really more like a fortified, sweet wine.\",\n",
       " 'Substantial and ripe, the fruit here feels soft and round in the mouth, like a mix of peaches, apricots and tangerines. There is less depth than you would hope for, but the flavors are sweet and lingering, and it leaves an impression of citrus rind as it tails away.',\n",
       " \"A rich, balanced and lovely Sauvignon Blanc. Fermented in stainless steel tanks, it's clean and crisp, with vibrant flavors of lemons, limes, vanilla, honeysuckle and spice. Sur lies aging adds a desirable texture of cream.\",\n",
       " \"Chardonnays from this vineyard always are powerful, but this bottling is over the top. It has ultraripe apricot and tangerine flavors, with strong acidity. Seems almost botrytised, with a honeyed intensity, although it's dry.\",\n",

       " 'A beautiful example of a fine Alexander Valley Cab, with dusty tannins and an herbal, thyme and sage note to the ripe blackberries, cherries, currants and cedar. Soft and tannic, this single-vineyard wine should develop over the next eight years, but is fully ready to drink now.',\n",
       " 'Made from all five classic Bordeaux varieties, this is a rich, softly tannic and delicious wine. It brims with jammy blackberry, dark chocolate and sweet cedar flavors, in a sweetly chewy texture that hints at further ageability. Drink now–2015.',\n",

       " 'From one of the westernmost vineyards in the county, just a few miles from the chilly Pacific, comes this dark, intense Pinot. Tasted in 2007, it was too tightly wound and too young to appreciate fully, with grapy, primary fruit flavors of blackberries, cherries and cola. It should be mellower now, however.',\n",
       " \"The Grisant Pinot Gris is more full and fleshy than the winery's LEHM bottling, but still a bit one dimensional. Pleasant flavors of pear fruit, skin phenolics and light suggestions of cinnamon.\",\n",

       " \"Ripe, smooth and delicious, this Cab offers tiers of blackberry jam, plum sauce, chocolate, licorice and oaky spice flavors. It's so soft, so beguiling, and despite the fruity power it's elegantly structured. A wine to savor as it warms in the glass. It wears its high alcohol well.\",\n",
       " \"There's a good wine in here, but it needs some time to escape the cage of hard tannins and primary fruit. Floods the mouth with blackberry pie, crème de cassis and sweet, vanilla oak flavors that are just itching for a good 5–7 years in the cellar.\",\n",
       " \"I like this wine a lot for the fruity flavors, rich tannins, subtle oak, crispness, long finish and overall balance. It's not as ripe as Cabs from warmer climates, and therefore may well be better with complex food.\",\n",

Shows the massively ripe character of the vintage, with a starburst of raspberries, cherries, cola, minerals and spices, while the acidity and tannins are just about perfect. This crowd pleaser is just extraordinary now, and should develop in the bottle over the next six years.',\n",

It's hugely deep in blackberries and black currants, with notes of dark chocolate and violets.

Best 2012–2018.\",\n",

       " \"“Nu” seems to be Kunde's way of letting us know that this is an unoaked Chardonnay. It shows pure, untrammelled Chard flavors of green apples, peaches, pears, kiwis and limes. It's also a very crisp wine, as it did not undergo the malolactic fermentation.\",\n",

Baking spices (brown sugar, allspice) and pepper add still more flavor interest, along with some lightly herbal influence. It's a distinctive, deep and seemingly quick-maturing wine that should be enjoyed now.\",\n",

It avoids the unripe pea vine or asparagus flavors that can afflict those wines, and brings light, fresh, sweetly grassy flavors to the palate. A little unfocused, but pleasurable and crisp, this is a good all-purpose seafood wine.',\n",

       " 'From an estate vineyard off Olivet Lane in the heart of the Santa Rosa Plain, this wine is comparatively intense and meaty compared to some of its counterparts from the cooler Sebastopol Hills.

       " \"Good for Hendry for going with this Spanish variety. It shows the new trend toward higher acid, drier white wines that appeal for their directness. With its citrus, pepper and flower flavors, it's perfect on its own, or with Asian, Mexican and grilled pork dishes.\",\n",

       " \"Great mouth presence, built upon stylish, racy fruit. It's tangy and spicy and handles the 100% new French oak with ease. Sappy and loaded with bright, tart red fruit flavors, this is a really pleasurable wine. Unfortunately, just 25 cases were made.\",\n",
       " \"Feels a little brittle, with lots of acidity giving a sharp edge to the cherries, currants, cola and sandalwood. The guess is whether the wine will mellow with time in the bottle, but that doesn't seem to be the case. Drink now, with rich fare for balance.\",\n",
       " 'Loaded with spice and mint, angular and focused, this extraordinary offering has a core of strikingly deep raspberry fruit. Around that core resonates a shell of minty herb, further defined by sharp tannins with an aromatic sandalwood component. As it breathes in the glass, it opens up further with cured, smoked meat flavors.',\n",

It's picking up dried blackberry, dessicated blueberry and beef jerky flavors that finish long and spicy. Yet it still has youthful acidity and freshness. This will be a fun wine to follow over the next five years.\",\n",
       " 'Aromas of beeswax and lemon oil, the flavors following along with tangerine, orange and peach. Very dry, with exceptional concentration of fruit, and well-integrated flavors of cracker and grain. This was barrel fermented, and delivers a long, concentrated finish.',\n",
       " \"The grape's floral component plays against its dense and inky tannins, making this a complete and relatively soft version of pure Petit Verdot. It fills in the usual midpalate hole with juicy fruit and softened tannins. It glides—not a word usually found with this as a varietal—into a silky, fruity, sweetly floral finish.\",\n",
       " 'Barrel fermented and aged on the lees for almost a year, this is a nutty, slightly oily wine that shows the influence of the barrel, but lacks the fruit density to match it. The 14% alcohol hits the palate with some heat. High-toned and a bit harsh.',\n",
       " \"Grown well inland, in a hot, arid part of the county, this Zin got superripe in the '07 vintage. It bursts with deep, rich flavors of blackberry pie filling, dark chocolate, anise and black pepper. The alcohol is extraordinarily high, approaching 16%, but there's really very little heat.\",\n",
       " \"The youthful acidity really strikes you, and so do the silky texture and enormous flavors, all of which make it textbook Garys'.

       " 'This sugary-sweet, frizzante-style sparkler is the sort of wine your grandmother might enjoy. It tastes like orange soda, only with 11% alcohol for a little extra kick in the back of the throat.',\n",
       " \"Feels awkward in the mouth now, with hard tannins and tart acids. However, it has an attractive richness of blackberries and cassis, enhanced with rich oak. It's a classically youthful Cabernet that should develop with 3–5 years in the bottle.\",\n",
       " \"This Syrah is marked by rich, extracted flavors. It's strong in blackberries, cherries and raspberries, coated with lots of smoky, caramelized oak. The deliciousness factor is very high. Drink now for decadent youthfulness.\",\n",
       " 'Strongly oaky at first sniff, this barrel-fermented reserve went through complete malolactic fermentation and a year and a half of barrel aging. The complexity comes out as it breathes open, a mélange of nuanced fruit including guava, peach, pineapple and green apple. Skin phenolics (from whole-cluster pressing) add some bite to the lengthy finish.',\n",
       " 'This blend showcases Grenache and Mourvèdre, with small amounts of Syrah, Counoise and Carignan. Raspberry, cherry and chocolate flavors combine with and are enlivened by a dash of white pepper. Excellent focus and length suggest that this can be cellared for at least five years.',\n",
       " 'Tastes as sweet and simple as a raspberry and cherry cola drink, with crisp acidity and a sugary finish.',\n",

       " \"The biggest and the smoothest of the J.Bookwalter wines, it's luscious and velvety, with a lanolin-like layer of flavors. A sweet clover scent rises up like seductive smoke, bringing in a full midpalate loaded with ripe strawberry, black cherry and sweet plum, mixed in with chocolaty oak.\",\n",
       " 'A solid Syrah, bone dry and well-rounded, with strong tannins that call for a rich steak. The flavors are earthy, suggesting blackberries, cherries, herbs, sweet leather and pepper. Drink now through 2010.',\n",
       " \"The vineyard was made famous by Williams Selyem for fantastically rich, ageable Pinot Noirs. Now Merry Edwards has her own bottling, and it's right up there.

Needs time, and will develop complexities through 2012, at least.\",\n",
       " \"Drily tannic, with an edge of tobacco, herbs and violets, this Syrah-based blend offers rich notes of black cherries, currants, cola and sandalwood. It's a well-made everyday red.\",\n",

       " 'A fantastic Cabernet that stuns now for authenticity and power, and should develop for many years. Despite the large production, lower than that of many first growth Bordeaux, the wine, which has tiny amounts of Cab Franc and Petit Verdot, shows classic Oakville elegance and precision. Rich in black currants, blackberries, cherries and dark chocolate, it should hit its stride from 2011 through 2017.',\n",
       " 'A bit tough and chewy, with firm tannins framing blackberry jam, teriaki beef and crushed black pepper flavors. Good and rich, but unresolved. Should benefit from about six years in the cellar.',\n",

       " \"In calling this southern Rhône-style blend Bistro Style, the winery means to suggest friends gathered in a nice restaurant, having fun and not being fussy about what's in the bottle. That perfectly describes this dry, soft red wine, with its flavors of blackberries, cherries and cocoa.\",\n",

       " 'A very nice wine, kind of a mongrel with its array of varietals, but rich and satisfying. Braced with crisp acidity, it offers flavors of tangerines, peaches, Meyer lemons, limes, green apples and honey, with a pleasant minerality. The blend is Viognier, Riesling, Sauvignon Blanc, Chardonnay and Pinot Gris.',\n",
       " 'Distinctly grassy, vegetal aromas add savoriness to this light-bodied, semi-dry style Riesling. On the palate, there are hints of quince, lemon and apple tinged with slate adding depth to an otherwise uncomplicated wine.',\n",
       " \"This wine has muscle and grip; it's a densely layered Cabernet, based upon cassis and loam, with firm, muscular tannins. At the moment it does not extend its power into the finish, but rather it seems to stop short. Try giving it extra breathing time.\",\n",
       " \"Thick and dense, with managed tannins and a nest of oak, this marquee wine offers classic insight into the Napa Valley. It's weighty and somewhat smoky, with a lurking sense of minerality and balance. A powerful grip gives way on the lengthy finish to satisfying end notes of coffee and toffee.\",\n",
       " 'This wonderfully refreshing, dry Riesling is redolent of ripe honeydew melon and freshly pressed Granny Smith apples. Lime and a nice steely backbone combine mid-palate with the sour tang of lemon drops and a lingering bitter almond finish.',\n",
       " \"A little heavy and overripe. There's a taste of prunes and chocolate in addition to the more classic cherries. Nicely dry and complex, but lacks vibrancy. Drink now.\",\n",
       " 'Made from Syrah, Cabernet Sauvignon and Zinfandel, this is a simple wine. It has cherry and spice flavors, with a cut of acidity.',\n",
       " \"Blended mainly from Grenache, with 20% Syrah, this is one of the biggest, most extracted red wines ever to come out of Paso Robles. The alcohol is a ridiculously high 16.2% by volume, but it's balanced the same way that high alcohol in Port is balanced. The flavors are enormously rich with raspberry and cherry jam, white chocolate and buttered toast. Heady and flashy in that distinctly California mode, and made for drinking now.\",\n",
       " \"Hot in high alcohol, which gives a burn that accentuates the pepper spice and makes it fierce. Yet it's fully dry and rich in blackberry, blueberry, anise and tobacco flavors. Defines the California superripe Zinfandel style.\",\n",
       " \"Richness alone would earn this Zinfandel a good score, but the overall balance uplifts it. It's simply delicious in wild berry, spice, mocha, salty bacon, vanilla toast and sandalwood flavors. Yet the tannins are fine, and the acidity is perfect. Even the slightly sweet finish and high alcohol work.\",\n",
       " 'Beautiful and likeable for its dryness, crisp minerality, and the sleek, clean mouthfeel. The fruit suggests oak-inspired pears, oranges and citrons. This elegant quaff gets better as it warms in the glass. Drink now.',\n",

       " 'This new Rock Island Red blends 50% Merlot, 39% Cabernet Sauvignon and 11% Cabernet Franc—a Meritage style with a beguiling blend of herbs and cherries. Sharp aromas include licorice and smoke; if the fruit had just a little more weight and depth this could compete with much pricier wines.',\n",
       " \"Like all of Carr's '08 Pinots, this one's marked by tart acidity. It gives a sour cherry candy taste and prickly mouthfeel. But it's quite rich, and as the wine breathes in the glass, its attractions mount. Give it two or three years in the cellar.\",\n",
       " \"Off in quality from previous vintages, Bell's '04 Bordeaux blend has a naggingly weedy, chlorophyll edge to the cherry and blackberry flavors. It's not going anywhere in the cellar.\",\n",

At this price, it's a giveaway.\",\n",
       " 'Nice cherry fruit, in a big, bold, forward, friendly style. The fruit is perfectly ripened, balanced, full and nicely handled, with nothing obscuring the clean, ripe flavors. Well-made wine, with no unnecessary frills.',\n",

It hits you head-on, dumps its plain fruit flavors and runs off, leaving a bit of volatile heat in the back of your mouth.\",\n",
       " 'Smells citrusy and oaky, with a distinct melon note. This is a simple, somewhat rough wine that expresses the most basic Chardonnay characteristics, but offers little beyond affordability.',\n",

       " \"The first sniff and taste tell you this is an important wine, but also a very young, tannic one. It's the structure, and not just the ripe flavors, that's so impeccable, giving the wine its backbone and strength. But speaking of flavors, the wine is gigantic in black currants and blackberries. One hundred percent new French oak is completely in accord with the size. Drink now, with decanting, and through 2015 at least.\",\n",
       " 'This wine comes from a vineyard planted in the early 2000s in the Sebastopol Hills by Charlie Chenoweth for the Jenkins family, a country music trio consisting of Nancy Jenkins and her two daughters.

Notes of bacon, licorice and sandalwood add further complexity. The structure is superb, with citrusy acids and supple tannins. All profits from the sale of this wine go to Jonata's vineyard crew.\",\n",
       " 'Very fruity and ripe, with jammy cherry, blackberry and raspberry flavors and a tease of chocolate-covered mint candy. Feels a bit abrupt and direct, so give it a decant and drink soon.',\n",
       " 'This dessert wine is comprised of Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Viognier and Chardonnay grapes. Its deeply colored, almost pink, and very rich and sweet in honey, orange, apricot and vanilla flavors. Extravagant, but could use greater structural interest.',\n",
       " 'At first pass, this feels a little tired, with a somewhat feeble nose and flavors that could tend toward bitter. But in the mouth, the wine impresses—the fruit is pretty and round, the mouthfeel smooth. Spice and fruit come together nicely and chase away any austerity that may be lurking. The finish is good and layered.',\n",
       " \"A hard wine to like, although it's clean and without technical flaws. Tastes very oaky now, with hard grapeskin and oak tannins giving an astringency to the superripe blackberry and cherry jelly flavors.\",\n",
       " 'Rich, dense, soft and incredibly concentrated, this Cabernet gives wave after wave of blackberry jam, chocolate, licorice and cedar flavors. Feels elegant, complex and fine. Drink now–2016.',\n",
       " \"From Nicholas Cole Cellars, this Merlot (74%), Cab Franc (15%), Cabernet Sauvignon (11%) blend is sourced from Klipsun, Champoux, Seven Hills and DuBrul vineyards. That's great fruit. It's a plummy wine with a raisiny edge that hints at early oxidation, and it's already showing some brick orange at the rim. Soft to the point of being a bit soapy in the mouth, it continues with mature flavors of black cherry, cola, molasses and chocolate. Drink this one now.\",\n",
       " \"This 100% Viognier was grown in the Bien Nacido Vineyard. It's bone dry, crisp in acidity and firm in wet stone minerals, while the rich fruit flavors suggest fresh, juicy citron, quince and sweet lime. Just wonderful, a bracing, pure, clean and pure example of a variety that can often be fussy.\",\n",
       " 'Lush and ripe, brimming with blackberry, chocolate and coffee flavors, this soft wine finishes with a distinct, cola-soda sweetness. Fortunately, crisp acidity is there for balance.',\n",
       " \"A lovely dessert wine in almost every respect. It's crisp in acidity and has complex, somewhat oxidized or Madeira-like flavors of oranges, tapioca and vanilla. Could be a little more focused and intense, but very fine, although it calls for a certain appreciation of this oxidative quality.\",\n",
       " 'Soft, smooth and elegant in texture, savory in flavor, this Central Coast Cab tastes of cherries, cassis, mocha and licorice. Smoky oak turns up on the finish. Forward enough to drink now, but it should hold for a couple of years.',\n",
       " \"Made in a big, ripe style, this is Gypsy Canyon's best Pinot Noir in years, but it will require some time in the cellar to soften. It's all forward, in-your-face jammy cherries now, with brusque tannins and lots of unintegrated new, smoky oak. Give it until 2013 to begin to come around.\",\n",
       " 'There is something comfortably old-fashioned about this 100% single-vineyard variety; the alcohol is at 13.5%, the fruit is moderately ripe and detailed with light herb and sweet spice. Wild blueberry aromas and flavors come wrapped in a thin layer of bark.',\n",
       " 'A first-rate Sauvignon Blanc. Bone dry and crisp and clean in mouthwatering acidity, it has wonderfully complex gooseberry, lime, grapefruit and kiwi flavors. Among the top of its class, and a great value.',\n",
       " \"With  this bottling, Kenneth Volk has produced the quintessential cool-climate, unoaked Chardonnay. The grape  variety reveals itself strongly, with classic peach and tropical fruit flavors that are very ripe, almost apricoty. The Santa Maria Valley's chilly climate shows up in brisk, mouthwatering acidity, while the finish is thoroughly dry. Additional richness was provided by sur-lie aging, which brings creamy notes.\",\n",
       " \"From the Los Alamos region, this young, firm Pinot wants a little time in the bottle to mellow. Tasted in January, it's unresolved in tannins, fresh acidity, oak (76% new) and primary cherry and raspberry fruit. Should be a very fine wine sometime toward 2011.\",\n",
       " 'Thick and foresty, this Pinot Noir embodies the extremes of the Perli Vineyard. It bursts with dark blue and earthy red fruits that are tempered by a savory undertone. This wine takes time to reveal itself, so age it for 5–7 years, and pair it with stews, risottos or seasoned braised lamb.',\n",
       " 'A beautiful Cabernet that drinks well now, and should develop bottle complexity through 2012. Dry and full-bodied, it shows black currant, black cherry, tobacco, cedar, anise and spice flavors, wrapped into sturdy tannins.',\n",
       " \"Not the greatest Backus ever, and not in the league of the 2001 and 2005. More akin to the 2000. But shows the power and superb tannin development of this fine Oakville vineyard. Nearly 100% Cabernet Sauvignon, it's flamboyant in blackberry, black currant and cedar flavors, with a grip of mineral or graphite. Should age quite well at least for the next 12 years, gradually losing tannins and gaining sweetness.\",\n",
       " 'This nonvintage red is a serviceable blend of Cabernet Sauvignon, Syrah and Zinfandel. Sharp, spicy and tannic, it has a bit of a green streak through the finish.',\n",
       " 'A very drinkable Carignane made from 40–90 year old certified organic vines grown in Mendocino, punched down by hand and given the gold-glove treatment. The result is juicy and delicious, full-bodied yet somehow light on its feet, a little blueberry here, a little spice there.',\n",
       " 'Fresh blackberry and boysenberry aromas meld with rose petal and hickory smoke on the warm entry of this bottling from Jonathan Nagy. The palate is packed with peppery spice, bright red cherry, thyme and root beer flavors.',\n",
       " 'Big red fruit embraces chewy, integrated tannins in this vineyard-designate, a full-bodied explosion of ripeness and bold expression. While powerful, it holds on to nuance via streaks of high-toned citrus, allowing the wine room to breathe and remain lighthearted.',\n",
       " 'Made in an immediately accessible style, this is a softly gentle, silky Pinot Noir with lots of delicious flavor. Brims with cherry pie filling, cola, anise, cinnamon and smoky, spicy sandalwood. Charming now, and complex enough for fine grills and roasts.',\n",
       " 'Ripe and juicy, this has flavors of tangerine and tropical fruit, plus notes of creamy lees and smoky, sweet oak. It would feel heavy if not for the brisk acidity that provides balance and elegance.',\n",
       " \"This blend is a nice wine to drink now. It's soft and fruity, with delicious black cherry, mocha, vanilla, anise and cinnamon spice flavors.\",\n",
       " \"This dessert wine has pushed itself to the front of the line of California sweeties, and the '04 is a great bottling. It's enormously sweet in late-harvest character, with apricot liqueur, pineapple tart and vanilla cream flavors that are brightened and boosted with cleansing acidity. So addictively delicious you just can't help yourself.\",\n",
       " 'Just beautiful, so well-crafted and balanced. With an edge of tannins and acids, could be an ager for a while. Shows a delicate structure, with cherry cola, raspberry, orange peel, vanilla and anise flavors that taste sweetly appealing, but are really bone dry. Now though 2012.',\n",
       " \"This blend of Marsanne, Roussanne and Viognier is rich and honeyed, with Meyer lemon chiffon pie and peach flavors that have a pleasant scour of acidity. It's a juicy, creamy and versatile wine at the table. Try as an offbeat alternative to Chardonnay.\",\n",
       " 'In this ripe vintage Folin has produced a full-throttle Tempranillo: tannic, chewy and firm. Blue plum and black cherry anchor the palate, with notes of tobacco, toast and composted earth.',\n",
       " 'Primitivo seldom has the elegance of true Zinfandel, and so it is here. Despite a resemblance to wild berry and spice flavors, the mouthfeel is rustic, and the finish is sweet.',\n",
       " \"A spicy, full-bodied Zin that shows Dry Creek's classic wild berry, red currant, cola, brambly herb and white pepper flavors. It's a big, lusty, high- alcohol wine that pairs with foods such as short ribs or beef tacos. Drink now.\",\n",
       " 'A new release for Concannon, this smallish release for the winery has honey, sweet vanilla, citrus and apricot, supported by a light, creamy mouthfeel. Finishing slightly sweet, with a coating of lemon, too, this would make a fine introduction to California Viognier for the novice.',\n",
       " \"From a section of the vineyard planted to only one clone, Paige's is luscious and velvety, smoothly decadent in sanguine, tangy fruit. Full bodied and in balance, it suggests a wild note of mint or bay leaf, something savory as one would find in a cassoulet or beef stew, two things with which it would pair well.\",\n",
       " \"There's a lot of slate minerality on the nose of this bottling, alongside bright and fresh boysenberry fruit and a pine-needle character. The palate is tart with plum skin and grippy tannins, well balanced and also showing just the right amount of barnyard funk.\",\n",
       " 'Concentrated and ruddy, this has ripe red-fruit flavors that are accented by savory spice and earthy tones of mushroom and autumn leaf. Soft and gentle on the palate, this has just a murmur of tannins.',\n",
       " 'This Merlot-based blend is dry, hard in tannins and brisk in acids. It has an intense core of blackberries, black currants and oak. Ready to drink now, it needs rich, oily foods, like short ribs, to cut through the astringency.',\n",
       " 'From the knoll on the eastern side of the Silverado Trail known as Pritchard Hill comes this sophisticated Cab. With a softly gentle mouthfeel comprised of rich, sweetly ripe tannins, blackberry and blueberry fruit and oak, it finishes completely dry. Drink now.',\n",
       " \"Here's a softly gentle, fruity Zinfandel. It's forward and one-dimensional in raspberry, cherry and red currant flavors, accented with black pepper and anise, and the finish is sweet, like a granola bar.\",\n",
       " 'Lots of delicious, complex blackberry, crème de cassis, mineral and cedar flavors in this dry, tannic wine. One quibble is the acidity, which is overly sharp and feels odd, given how ripe the wine is.',\n",
       " \"Quite earthy in profile with hints of smoke, petroleum and fresh green herbs, there's a distinct minerality in this off-dry Riesling that's compelling. Brisk lime-juice acidity and a hint of citrus rind bitterness accentuates the dry finish.\",\n",
       " \"Far and away the best red in the winery's entire lineup, this deeply fruity wine is loaded with concentrated blackberry flavors. It's a dark and stormy night of a wine, with thick tarry tannins and a streak of espresso to wrap it up.\",\n",
       " \"Here's a rich Chardonnay with tropical fruit pastry flavors that have a dusty, dried herb edge, and lots of creamy oak. The wine is a bit soft. The fruit and spice flavors reprise on the long-lasting finish.\",\n",
       " 'A good effort in a challenging vintage. This has a warm core of round, pretty cherry fruit, with a dash of bitters, sassafras and caramel. It persists through the middle into a Dr. Pepper finish, with details of herb and earth.',\n",
       " \"There's a Floodgate Vineyard in Anderson Valley that produces very nice Pinot Noirs, but this one says it's from Russian River Valley. This wine is average in quality. It has a fine, silky mouthfeel, with some good cherry flavors, but also a sharp, green touch of mint that's unlikely to age out.\",\n",
       " 'A little sweet and high in alcohol for my taste, this wine, which winemaker Greg La Follette calls “a fruit riot,” indeed is explosive. Cherries, blueberries and black raspberries run rampant, with overtones of milk chocolate and coffee. On the plus side are rich, dusty tannins and good acidity, which lend structure.',\n",
       " 'Good everyday Zin, a little green, but rich enough in raspberry and cherry flavors with a hit of spice. The dryness and moderate alcohol win extra points.',\n",
       " 'A bit soft and direct, but appeals for its rich flavors of pineapples, buttered toast, cinnamon and smoke. Shows a firm minerality at its core. Drink now.',\n",
       " \"Yummy, with ripe, plush berries running rampant across the tongue. The juicy acids and underlying minerality add lift and life, but the fruit, rolling from cranberry to boysenberry to blackberry, just won't let go. The structure suggests ageability for another decade of more.\",\n",
       " 'Tannic and fruity, with a raw mouthfeel, this dry young wine is meant to wash down steaks, chops and so forth. Not likely to age, so drink now. Cabernet, Merlot, Sangiovese and Petite Sirah.',\n",
       " 'Sharp and dry, this Chianti-style wine has cherry, date, grilled mushroom, balsam and vanilla flavors. The nicest part is the silky texture, light and elegant, like a Pinot Noir. Needs rich meats, pasta or risotto to show its best.',\n",
       " \"This is the winery's off-dry sparkler. It's super-clean and crisp, with honeyed flavors of oranges and tangerines. A nice sip with fresh fruits, smoked ham, asparagus wrapped in prosciutto.\",\n",
       " \"Run, don't walk, to get this Cab at this price. It's very rich and delicious, offering waves of cherries, raspberries, blackberries, chocolate, smoky oak and spices. Feels round and supple and soft in the mouth, making it fine for drinking now. Production was 4,400 cases.\",\n",
       " 'Disconnected in its youth, with separate oak and fruit elements that need time to find each other and marry. The oak shows up as caramel and butterscotch, while the fruit stands aloof, in blackberry and black currant superiority. Seems to have the inherent balance for aging. Try after 2013.',\n",
       " \"Like the winery's “Fuller” Pinot Noir, this special, limited-edition offering honors some Oregon wine industry stalwarts, the owners of Elton Vineyards. It clearly reflects the flavors of the Eola-Amity Hills AVA—no tricks or attempts to hide the natural earthy, herbal character. Herb and sassafras, pine needle and sour cherry, spice and even a hint of pickle barrel (American oak?) mingle pleasantly, and the alcohol remains at a comfortable 13.3%.\",\n",
       " \"The vineyard is in the northwestern, coolest part of the Highlands, which is most susceptible to the chilly winds that blow in from Monterey Bay. You can taste the salty tang of the sea, and the wine certainly is high in acidity. It's also deep in cherry, raspberry, currant, cola and spice flavors. Delicious now, and should mellow over the next six years.\",\n",
       " 'Too sweet, with jammy pineapple and oak flavors. Crisp acidity and some minerality help to restore balance, but  the sugary taste is off-putting.',\n",
       " \"This is Baileyana's top Chardonnay, and the '06 defines what makes Edna Valley such a special place to grow it. Acidity and ripeness are the stars, with bright, explosive flavors of pineapples, pears, Meyer lemons, limes and kiwi fruits. The smoky, spicy oak is perfectly integrated into this delightful wine.\",\n",
       " 'Rather dark and full-bodied for a blush wine, with candied raspberry and cherry flavors and a spicy, vanilla-sweet finish. I like the flavors, but the heaviness and sweetness are awkward.',\n",
       " \"This is a very good Cabernet that shows its mountain origins in the thick tannins and overall concentration. It's superrich in blackberries, black currants and crème de cassis, with a tangy minerality. There's also a cut of acidity that makes the mouthfeel tart, and will never go away. Seems at its best over the next few years for youthful beauty.\",\n",
       " 'A bit too sweet for comfort. The tannins are soft and refined, and the blackberry, cocoa and spice flavors are just fine. But that sugary finish makes it unbalanced.',\n",
       " \"This is the first release from the winery's new estate vineyard. It's Cabernet all the way—two-thirds Sauv, one-third Franc. Fragrant and charming, scented with sweet strawberry, smoked ham, light cracker and fresh herb. It's a graceful wine that shows how much elegance Yakima Valley fruit can express when carefully grown and vinified.\",\n",
       " \"A step up from the Vin du Lac Merlot, this includes 16% Merlot and 8% Malbec in the blend, and profits from it, with dusty, sweet fruit that is not overwhelmed by the new oak. In the mouth, details from the 22 months it was aged in barrel begin to emerge, it's not just a wash of vanilla and chocolate, but shows added complexity and texture.\",\n",
       " \"There's lots of structure here. Acidity stars, making this brisk, and lifting the cherry, cola and oak flavors up and out. A dry, elegant young Pinot.\",\n",
       " \"The '98 Klipsun, from a premier vineyard on Red Mountain, is even better than the '97. It has a richness and ripeness in the cherry-flavored fruit, but retains the extra dimensions that Red Mountain soil imparts: flavors of iron, mineral and chalk. It's just a little hot in the finish, but not distractingly so. This is a very cleanly made wine, with no earthiness to it. As with all Seven Hills wines, it's built to age, though fine for near-term enjoyment. Editors' Choice.\",\n",
       " 'Quite a solid deal from an expert Zin house, this wine shows aromas of candied cherry and pomegranate, with cinnamon, a hint of tar and a little crushed espresso bean. Dried blueberries enliven the palate, along with mineral tones and more cinnamon-based baking spice.',\n",
       " \"The winery's '05 reserve is oakier than their regular Chard, and the wine is heavier and less fresh, an impression heightened by full malolactic fermentation, which has softened the acidity and given a buttery taste.\",\n",
       " \"There isn't much Sangio in Washington, but the Pepper Bridge fruit is the pick of the litter. Ripe and nicely colored, this is 100% Sangiovese and actually shows some hints of pepper, tobacco and tea leaf. Still, the vineyard is in Walla Walla, not Tuscany, and the wine tastes more like a lightweight Syrah than a Chianti.\",\n",
       " 'This is an irresistibly delicious Pinot Noir. It shows the virtues of the vintage through flashy flavors of black cherry pie filling, red currants, cherry liqueur, orange zest, mocha, vanilla and cinnamon spice, wrapped into lush, silky tannins and brightened by firm acidity. Complex and compelling.',\n",
       " \"This Two Blondes is the best ever—powerful and ripe, with a plush mix of raspberry and strawberry fruit, tart and tangy and mouthfilling. This wine has a huge midpalate, but doesn't stop there; as it slowly winds through a full-throttle finish, threads of chocolate, coconut, caramel and coffee appear. The flavors go on for several minutes.\",\n",
       " \"I wish this wine were drier because it has polished citrus, floral and mineral flavors and a rich, pronounced acidity. But it's sugary throughout.\",\n",
       " \"An interesting wine, somewhat sharp and yeasty upon entry, but also showing a creamy, textural midpalate with a streak of honey down the fruit flavors of pear and apple. It's dry, persistent, and distinctive, though not typical for Oregon Pinot Gris.\",\n",
       " \"Incredible fruit intensity. Cranberry, pomegranate and cherry meet rock, gravel and pepper. Lovely focus and purity; it's concentrated and tight, with a minerality that is compelling and distinctive. The best yet from Cailloux. Syrah is co-fermented with 4 or 5% Viognier.  It's a world-class effort, still quite young and tight, but built for beautiful aging.\",\n",
       " 'Thyme and lavender notes mingle with orange, tangerine and banana aromas and flavors in this exotic, stylized wine. An ample dose of spicy new oak brings dimension, but also adds a dry, slightly austere note to the long finish. Appealing now; may integrate better with short-term cellaring.',\n",
       " 'Made from Grenache Blanc and Viognier, this pretty and enormously likeable white wine was barrel fermented. It has pleasant flavors of citrus fruits, raspberries, vanilla, white pepper, buttered toast and sandalwood. The finish is clean and zesty.',\n",
       " \"This Bordeaux-style blend is mostly Cabernet Sauvignon, with small percentages of Cabernet Franc, Malbec and Merlot. It's high-toned, and it comes with a pungency that brightens the highly extracted, sweet-tasting berry fruit. It has lots of appeal, but you must like wines that have a volatile edge.\",\n",
       " 'Direct and bold in cherries, raspberries, chocolate and spices, this is a tasty Syrah. The richness is wrapped into fine, sweet tannins, with a tweet of smoky oak. Drink now.',\n",
       " \"A blend of just over one-third Riesling, Atwater's Riewürz boasts a steely precision that cuts through all of Gewürztraminer's ebullient floral and juicy fruit characteristics. Semidry on the palate, with deliciously concentrated pomelo flavors, it finishes on a zesty, candied orange-peel note.\",\n",
       " \"A good, soft wine to drink now with a steak or chop. It's full-bodied and very rich in extracted blackberry jam and crème de cassis flavor, with touches of pepper, cocoa and bacon.\",\n",
       " 'Here is a classic Klipsun nose, scented with dark streaks of metal and earth. The dark, mineral notes are not yet integrated with the fruit, which is high-toned and earthy, with some barnyard flavors. The tannins are rough and rustic, and give the impression that the wine needs more time to smooth out.',\n",
       " \"This is a big, hard, tannic wine. It's so buttoned up, the question is whether it will age. Most of the signs say yes. It's gigantically rich in blackberries, cassis and chocolate, with a berried sweetness accented by the caramel of toasted oak. Acidity is just fine. On the other hand, the alcohol is notable, giving it peppery heat. A very fine, flashy, impressive wine, but its future is obscure.\",\n",
       " \"Dry and zesty in mouthwatering acidity, this clean wine features upfront flavors of lemons, limes, grapefruits and oranges. It's a nice cocktail sipper at a good price.\",\n",
       " \"The color is a bit murky, but the wine offers sound, solid varietal aromas and plenty of sweet fruit. It's definitely front-loaded, with sweet cherry/berry and a nicely managed finish with a lick of chocolate. It shows the California influence of the winemaker, who is based in Santa Rosa.\",\n",
       " \"Only two barrels were made of this pure Malbec, a tightly wound wine with a well-defined mix of berry, bramble, bark and herb. It shows good balance and good length, with a finish that's streaked with notes of coffee and chocolate.\",\n",
       " \"This is one of the top vineyards in the appellation, sought by anyone who can get the grapes. Co-owner Kathy Joseph has crafted a voluptuous, sensual Pinot that's soft, beguiling and superrich in cherry pie, smoky char and cinnamon-spicy vanilla flavors. It's the kind of Pinot everyone wants to make but usually can't.\",\n",
       " \"A dry wine, companion to the winery's off-dry estate bottling. This does not give up its fruit as some dry Rieslings do; there is a pleasing mix of lemon, grapefruit, pineapple and apricot, full in the mid-palate, then turning more astringent and cheerily tart in the finish. This is very young, compact, and still tight as a drum; it could be cellared for up to a decade.\",\n",
       " \"There's a fine Pinot in here, but it's like buried treasure. Currently locked down with tannins, the wine shows extravagant flavors of dusty Asian spices, rhubarb, pomegranate, cola, cherryskin and sandalwood. Desperately needs time, but should be very fine. Drink 2011 through 2015.\",\n",
       " 'Smells great, impressing with a burst of black pepper-inspired mashed ripe blackberries and grilled meat bone.

       " \"One sip of this blend is all it takes to conclude that it's quite a good wine. Dry and balanced, with smooth tannins, it houses blackberry, black cherry, cassis, teryaki beef and sandalwood flavors. Gains extra points for sheer elegance of structure. Now–2013.\",\n",
       " 'This is quite light and lemony, closer to an Italian Pinot Grigio than to an Oregon Pinot Gris. What it lacks in flesh it compensates for in freshness and vitality; the subtle fruit flavors suggest Asian pear, jicama and cucumber. It would be a lovely match for a light fish such as rainbow trout or Dover sole.',\n",
       " 'With very slight oak, but aged on the lees, this Sauvignon Blanc has richness that outshines the underlying fruit, which suggests lemons and limes. The wine was not put through the malolactic fermentation, so acidity is brisk. Good job for a fancy wine at a decent price.',\n",
       " 'Sandalwood and a shovelful of fresh earth mark the entry of this wine aromatically. A soft, tart expression of the variety, it offers bittersweet tannin and dark cherry at its core.',\n",

Immense in blackberry, cassis, mocha and dusty Asian spices, it's gorgeously rich and decadent.\",\n",
       " 'A very “Burgundian” Pinot Noir in the mushroom, pine needle and herb scents that accompany the deeper fruit flavors of black cherries and red currants, accented with savory clove spice. Structurally, the wine shows a brilliant architecture of firm tannins and crisp acids, with a deft touch of oak. Really a treat to drink, and should evolve for many years.',\n",
       " 'No oak to interfere with the ripe, opulent flavors of pineapples, lemons, limes and tangerines, which are brightened and heightened by crisp acidity. The price is right on this balanced, savory Chardonnay.',\n",
       " \"I have not been a great fan of this winery's Bordeaux reds, and this one also has a countrified thing going on, despite some very ripe and lip-smacking cherry flavors. Half the oak barrels it was aged in were new.\",\n",

       " \"Thin and disjointed, with strawberry soda fruit flavors that drop off quickly into an amorphous midpalate. There's some plastic aftertaste in the finish.\",\n",

       " \"They say the vines are 68 years old, and they certainly produced a dense, concentrated young Zin. It's like the liquid essence of raspberries, cherries and blackberries, enriched with a dusting of cinnamon, cocoa, coffee and nutmeg. The finish is completely dry. One problem: acidity is very low, making the wine soft and a little medicinal.\",\n",
       " \"Chardonnay doesn't get much riper or richer than this. Dazzles with pear jam, pineapple custard, crème brûlée, buttered toast and cinnamon spice flavors, and a firm grounding of minerals. Calls for the richest possible foods, like lobster. Drink now.\",\n",

       " 'Fruity, tannic and sharp in acids, this Syrah has stewed cherry, blackberry and pineapple flavors that taste like they were lightly sugared, then baked into a pie. Drink now.',\n",
       " 'Herbal and tight, with a whiff of burnt rubber in front of some tart fruit. There is some concentration, and with more bottle age the wine may yet flesh out a bit.',\n",
       " \"Enticingly nutty on the nose, with hints of smoke, yeast and apricot kernel, this 2003 vintage bottling from Swedish Hill shows promising signs of development. While fairly aggressive on the attack, it's clean and lemony on the palate, with a softly saline, sea breeze note on the finish.\",\n",
       " 'Concentrated and stylish, this is a potent Merlot with sharp, ripe, tight fruit flavors. Compact plum, black cherry and cassis fruit is wrapped in juicy acids and plenty of coffee-flavored barrel toast. Still young and a bit hot, this wine needs several hours of breathing time to really open up.',\n",
       " \"A blend of Grenache and Syrah, this wine is dry and softly balanced. It has pleasant flavors of cherries, raspberries, cola and spice, with a wild edge of thyme and lavender. A simple country wine, it's showing its best now.\",\n",
       " \"This new cuvée takes its name from the fermentation practice of mixing whole berries with grape-cluster stalks—just stalks, not whole clusters. Herbs and pine needle flavors dominate brambly berry fruit. It's quite young and raw, and will benefit from further bottle age.\",\n",
       " 'This is one of the few California Syrahs that demands time in the cellar. Its tough tannins form an aloof astringency that makes it virtually undrinkable now, but it has an incredible core of blackberry, black currant and dark chocolate fruit. Peppery, anise, leather and spice notes, in addition to slightly caramelized vanillins from 100% new oak, impart great complexity. Best 2012 and beyond.',\n",
       " 'Smooth and supple, almost silky, this dense and delightful Syrah begins with a smoky, meaty run of sweet cherry and berry flavors, then quickly adds interesting nuances of herb and leaf and earth. The cherry fruit triumphs, along with cut tobacco and a whiff of clove, as it weaves through a long finish.',\n",
       " \"Big and powerful, but nuanced despite its size. It's a dark, extracted wine, filled with wild cherry, raspberry, currant and sandalwood flavors, as well as exotic notes of forest balsam, grilled mushrooms, tamari and dusty Indian spices. Super-complex, it changes with every sip, and should change interestingly over the next six years. The vineyard is in the Petaluma Gap, and argues strongly for that region's future.\",\n",
       " 'This blend of all the Bordeaux varieties satisfies for its wealth of well-ripened fruit. It just floods the mouth with the flavors of crushed, perfectly ripe blackberries, black raspberries and wild cherries, picked under the warm summer sun. Oak adds smoky nuances. A good job from Madrona. Drink now.',\n",
       " \"Fresh and tart in acidity, this is a clean, savory evocation of a variety that few Californians manage to produce this well. It's rich in apple, citrus, peach and floral flavors, with a lychee, spicy complexity that makes it a natural for Asian fare.\",\n",
       " 'This Bordeaux blend from Sunstone has been getting softer, sweeter and more melted over the years. This latest bottling is almost like a dessert wine, with pastry-like cherry, currant, cocoa, anise and vanilla flavors. It lacks structure and full dryness.',\n",
       " 'A young, distinguished Cab, made in the modern style of softness, ripeness and apparent sweetness. Floods the mouth with blackberries, black cherries, anise, chocolate, pepper and smoky oak. Should improve over the next 6-8 years.',\n",
       " 'A velvety, sinewy blend of 40% Syrah, 40% Grenache and 20% Mourvèdre from estate-grown and nearby vineyards, this wine offers a lot to like, from textured tannins to succulent blueberry and plum. Intense and floral, it finishes with an explosion of white pepper.',\n",
       " 'Superb, opulent, just wonderful. Hard to exaggerate the beauty of this 100% Cabernet Sauvignon. Fantastically ripe and rich in black cherries, currants, sandalwood and spices, with a grounding streak of herbs. Beyond the flavors is the near-perfect structure, marked by smooth, complex tannins. Finishes sweet but completely dry, the paradox of a great wine. Drink now–2015.',\n",
       " \"A blend of the Tablas Creek and Alban clones, this Grenache is from the Stolpman Vineyard. Made using whole clusters in the fermentation, it's densely textured and brooding in tannins. But there's an enormous core of cherry fruit and spice. Should blossom in 2009 and hold for several more years.\",\n",
       " 'Shows great acidity that really gets the tastebuds whistling, and also deep, complex varietal flavors of Meyer lemons, limes and sweet vanilla, with a green grass component in the background. Very fine and dry, an elegant, sophisticated Sauvignon Blanc of great integrity.',\n",
       " \"Dry and robust, this Zin has briary, brambly flavors set off by a rich, slightly bitter streak of red currants and tobacco. It's a full-bodied, tannic wine whose peppery spices will play well against a grilled steak.\",\n",
       " 'Butter and vanilla wrap around tropical fruit and citrus flavors on the full nose. Baked apples, crème caramel and abundant new oak merge to provide this chard with a slightly viscous, buttery texture. Its rich butter and oak may be a bit too much for some. The tangy finish is long and tasty.',\n",
       " \"Very ripe and exuberant, with powerful blackberry, currant, cassis, mineral and cedar flavors. But it's also tough and hard in tannins, and not showing well now. Needs time. Best after 2010.\",\n",
       " \"Another great RSR. A bit soft, but that's okay, as the pineapple custard, white peach and vanilla-oak flavors are perked up by bright citron and Meyer lemon. The finish is pure honey, rich and long and spicy. Such a complex wine.\",\n",
       " 'This Bordeaux blend almost touches 15% alcohol, yet the fruit flavors remain lightly candied, like a cherry Lifesaver. Hints of fresh tobacco leaf and toasted cracker creep in as it breathes, along with some high-toned volatile aromas.',\n",
       " \"This tastes soft and sweet, with citrus, green apple and apricot flavors. It's an easy wine to drink with slightly-sweet southeast Asian fare.\",\n",
       " \"With 6 Rhône varieties, including Viognier, this is a fresh, fruity wine meant to be consumed within the next five years. It's strong in cherry, blackberry and other berry flavors, with the smoky vanilla of oak.\",\n",
       " 'A little sharp in the mouth, with a bite of citrusy acidity, but the cherry, cola, pomegranate and sandalwood flavors are very rich, and the texture is silky. The acidity could resolve in a few years. Best by 2012 or so.',\n",
       " \"An eccentric, although likeable, Cab. It shows the dryness and tannic astringency that Atlas Peak Cabs are famous for, along with upfront, accessibly New World flavors of cherry jam, black currants and cedar. Hard to know if it's an ager, but it's a pretty good wine.\",\n",

    "To train our model, we are going to have to convert all of our categorical features (i.e. text) into continuous features (i.e. numbers). This is a very common process that is performed for training Machine Learning models, as features are often categorical in datasets. Machine Learning algorithms work purely with numbers to perform various tasks such as regression (e.g. predicting housing prices when given the square footage and location of a house) and classification (e.g. predicting whether or not a tumor is malignant, given the mass of the tumor). We will convert all of the categorical features except for the description feature, which we will touch on this in a bit."
