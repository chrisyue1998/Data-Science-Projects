       "{\"This is one of those Chardonnays that's delicious from the first sip. It's not complicated, but is rich in mango, yellow peach and oak-inspired buttered toast, butterscotch, honey and vanilla bean flavors. The grapes are from the Oak Knoll District, and the wine has refreshing acidity.\",\n",
       " 'If you smelled this blind you might think it was Sauvignon Blanc. But swirl it, let it breathe, and the rosehip tea comes along. In the mouth, the wine is crisp  with tea, cherry skin and root beer flavors.',\n",
       " \"Tasted in a flight with far more expensive wines, this Pinot stood proud. It's dry and richly complex, with the silk-and-satin texture you want. The flavors reward with cherries, cola, Canadian bacon, Indian spices and sandalwood. At this price, it's a steal.\",\n",
       " 'Crisp minerality and full fruit flavors of apricot and lemon are the hallmarks of this classic New York Riesling. A plate of freshwater fish or a sampling of cheese and apples would pair perfectly here.',\n",
       " 'This has the sharp, citrus skin phenolics characteristic of many Viogniers, but a rather soft middle tastes like green bananas more than citrus. Those banana flavors roll into the finish, then quickly fade.',\n",
       " 'This is a bit sweaty in the nose, with a mousy undertaste that takes some time to blow off. Sour and unresolved; nothing really connects here. Very tart, with unripe citrus, pale red fruits, and a little toast and chocolate.',\n",
       " \"An Aussie-style blend of 78% Sauvignon Blanc and 22% Sémillon. It's been a real success for Cadaretta, and this is in the same mold as previous efforts. Tasted just prior to release, it was loaded with crisp, primary fruit flavors of green apple, melon and grapefruit. Nice texture, and just a hint of barrel toast too.\",\n",
       " \"Confusingly, a sparkler labeled extra dry is actually extra sweet. It's a French convention that probably should not have been carried over into American labeling, for it simply muddies the water. This is not terribly sweet or sugary, and has a distinctive, lime-flavored citrus streak.\",\n",
       " \"A terrific Chardonnay. You won't miss the oak at all. Offers a wealth of pineapple pie, Meyer lemon sorbet, green apple jam and vanilla flavors, brightened by clean, crisp coastal acidity. Sommeliers, buy this one in quantity. Easy to find, with 45,000 cases produced.\",\n",
       " 'A perfect evocation of how beautifully Sauvignon Blanc expresses itself in the Happy Canyon area of the Santa Ynez Valley. With no oak, and without the malolactic fermentation, what you get is pure fruit. Crisp, mouthwatering acidity frames beautiful flavors of Meyer lemons, limes, peaches, minerals and, yes, gooseberries. What a wonderful food wine.',\n",
       " \"I'd like to like this wine more than I do, because the acidity is brilliantly clean and scouring, which is a good thing, and the citrus, gooseberry, fig and wildflower flavors are very Marlborough-like. But the sugary finish is a letdown.\",\n",
       " \"The ripest of Curtis's new Syrahs, this bottle is powerful in chocolate, blackberry and cherry jam flavors, with an edge of sweet, spicy bacon. It's a rich, tasty wine meant for drinking now.\",\n",
       " \"This Pinot would have benefited from being held back before release at the age of one year. It shows a certain immaturity, with primary fruit flavors that are unintegrated with the oak. But it's rich and opulent. Give it until late 2009.\",\n",
       " \"La Fenetre scores with this lush, forward Pinot Noir that offers enough flavor to please almost anybody. It's enormously rich in raspberry and cherry pie filling, roasted almond granola, vanilla cream, buttered cinnamon toast and sandalwood flavors that are so delicious, they're sweet, except that the wine finishes dry. Great with lamb. Drink now.\",\n",
       " 'A bit tough and gritty in tannin structure, with sweetly jammy flavors of raspberries, cherries and red plums, accented with smoky oak. Seems at its best now.',\n",
       " \"This Syrah shows the bright fruit and crisp, organizing acidity of Domaine Alfred's Chamisal botting, which is their reserve, without quite the lushness and power. Nonetheless, it's a fine Syrah, firm and dry in tannins, with fat, sappy texture framing jammy cherry, blackberry and peppery fruit.\",\n",
       " \"When our tasting panel team tasted the '02 a few years ago, we found it heavy, but possibly a sleeper. The '03 is in the same vein. While it lacks a certain vibrancy and has tannic weight, the deeply flavored core of cherries is impressive and suggests mid-term aging.\",\n",
       " 'For the past several years, this Zin has suffered from the same flaw, excessive alcohol. Some wines get away with it. This one, with its raisiny, baked fruit taste, harsh tannins and hot mouthfeel, does not.',\n",
       " \"A blend of Syrah, Grenache, Mourvèdre and Petite Sirah, this wine shows a rustic but easy drinking quality. It's fairly tannic, with a long finish of cherries, blackberries and spiced coffee.\",\n",
       " 'Packs plenty of punch into an inexpensive, everyday Chardonnay. With brisk, tangy acidity, it offers rich, appealing flavors of pineapples, green apples, vanilla and sweet, creamy butter.',\n",
       " 'A firm, somewhat muscular wine, blending in 16% Merlot and aged in neutral oak barrels. Leaf and truffle notes abound, with the distinctively acidic underpinning of Sangiovese. Light strawberry-cherry fruit gently fades through a clean finish.',\n",
       " \"This is a very concentrated and intense young Sauvignon Blanc. With 43% new oak, it shows a rich creaminess riding over the laser-like gooseberry, grapefruit and lime flavors. It's also extremely crisp in acidity, since malolactic fermentation was entirely prevented.\",\n",
       " \"Loie's Block is the oldest in the Maresh vineyard, and shows the elegance and grace of old vines. The wine is sculpted and feminine, but not bashful. Its sweet cherry core is wrapped in piney tannins—the herbs jut out, as often happens in young Oregon Pinot Noir. The angularity and definition suggest that a bit of time will turn this into a multi-dimensional, Burgundian wine.\",\n",
       " 'This is a bold, oaky Chardonnay. Toasty roasted-nut aromas lead the charge, followed by hints of peach and melon, while a strong vanilla component comes forward on the palate. Finishes warm, with prominent oak spice.',\n",
       " 'Lots going on with this affordable Zin. Dry and smooth, it shows exuberant flavors of black pepper, red currants, teriaki beef, anise and smoke. With a richly tannic mouthfeel, it will pair well with grilled meats.',\n",
       " 'Strong blueberry and black-cherry aromas mesh with cedar spice and tobacco ash on this rather elegant nose. A balsamic blueberry reduction flavor shows on the palate, where fine-grained tannins also present smashed vanilla flavors.',\n",
       " \"A tart, all-purpose red, with 14 different grapes in the blend. The result, predictably, is generic. No particular variety dominates; it's a high acid red wine, with stiff tannins.\",\n",
       " \"This is a newer vineyard and sometimes the wines can have that fresh, jammy taste you get from young vines that may have been over-cropped. So it is with the '05, a cool vintage whose acidity accentuates the sharpness. The blackberry and cherry flavors are dry, and finish sharp and simple.\",\n",
       " 'After a couple of off years, this bottling is back on form. The Porty edge is gone, and in its place is a gorgeously ripe wine with full control over the fruit. Raspberries, cherries, cassis, pecan pie, pumpkin pie, cocoa, gingerbread, cola, vanilla, Asian spice; the list goes on and on. Meanwhile the mouthfeel is pure velvet, the finish long-lasting. This is Dry Creek Valley Zin at its best.',\n",
       " 'From a cool Forestville vineyard once devoted to apples, Appian Way is rich in Goldridge soils, providing a happy home to these grapes that offer a core of pomegranate and cranberry, laced in black tea. Light bodied without being wimpy, the wine is complex and velvety, finishing in nutmeg and ginger.',\n",
       " \"Brut X is an extreme brut, made in a bone-dry style from a blend of 31% Chardonnay and 69% Pinot Noir with no added sugar. It's then aged four years. Floral in honeysuckle, the flavors are sharply focused and salty, a mix of lemon, pear and peach that can be enjoyed before, during and after a meal.\",\n",
       " 'This is an aromatic, honeysuckle-tinged cool-climate white, with layers of honey and spice. Light in body and texture, this complex, Alsace-style effort is the perfect accompaniment to Thai, Indian, Korean barbecue or spicy Chinese food.',\n",
       " \"Wilderness is Chris Sparkman's most affordable and most available wine, a mix of all the barrels and vineyards that go into his other reds. It is forward, loaded with mixed red and black fruits, and lusciously chocolaty. What it does not have is the focus of the other wines; this one's a lap dog, and wants to lick you all over.\",\n",
       " \"Always one of the best Muscats in California, Eberle's '09 continues the tradition. It offers tangerine, pineapple, vanilla cream and honeysuckle flavors in a frankly sweet wine finished with brisk, cleansing acidity.\",\n",
       " 'A lively citrus tang balances the rounder fig, melon, toast and dried spice flavors that predominate here. Finishes evenly with medium length. It seems to be at its peak, so drink this round and well-integrated Chardonnay up now.',\n",
       " 'A bit raw and grainy in tannins, giving it a sandpapery mouthfeel, but otherwise quite flavorful. Shows ripely sweet blackberries, cherries, black and red currants and smoky new oak. Best now and through 2012.',\n",
       " \"This budget-priced Syrah offers hints of why the grape does so well in Washington. It has a bit of peppery bite, some very tart cranberry fruit, crisp acids and a lifted, citrusy finish. Clean and varietal, it's a good everyday effort.\",\n",
       " \"One of the most distinctive among Adelsheim's single-vineyard Pinot Noirs, the Calkins Lane bottling does not shy away from earthy, herbal flavors, including forest floor, truffle and wet leaf. But there's plenty of fruit, a mix of ripe red apple, pomegranate, wild cherry and plum.\",\n",
       " 'A lush, velvety, ripe Pinot Noir made in the modern California style of immediate accessibility. Shows forward flavors of raspberry and cherry pie, cocoa, cinnamon, cola and anise, with lots of sweet, toasty oak. Seems best now in its decadent youth.',\n",
       " \"This Bordeaux-Rhône blend is tannic and hard in the mouth. It's like chewing on leather, with a beef jerky toughness to the blackberry and cherry flavors. The idea seems to be ageability, but the future of this wine is far from certain.\",\n",
       " \"A Cab-based Bordeaux blend with a little Syrah, this wine tastes surprisingly cooked for such a cool vintage. There's a raisiny, smoky, baked blackberry and cherry flavor that makes for an imbalance that won't age away.\",\n",
       " 'This blend of mainly Syrah, with Grenache, is heavy and dull, with candied raspberry-cherry flavors that finish a little sweet.',\n",
       " 'Great price for a Pinot Noir this rich and fancy. It really flatters the palate, offering waves of raspberry, cherry, root beer, vanilla and sandalwood flavors, with a spicy finish. The light, silky texture is especially nice, as is the low alcohol balance.',\n",
       " 'Quite full bodied and obviously powerful in flavor, this wine is piled deep and rich with fruit aromas and flavors like ripe blackberries and blueberries plus chocolate and espresso. An impressive, astringent texture adds structure and makes it appetizing to drink, while the tannins seem to help the opulent flavors linger during the aftertaste.',\n",
       " 'Just two barrels were made of this wine, a new release based upon a vineyard selection and a decision to use no new oak. Admirable in concept, but not quite there in execution, this wine is soft and earthy, with plum and a whiff of cocoa. The midpalate seems to have a slight dip in it, not a hole, but not a smooth ride either.',\n",
       " 'Darker than most of the wines in a big Rhône tasting, this dramatic Grenache, Syrah and Mourvèdre bottling is full-bodied and rich. It offers waves of chocolate and blackberries, with oak providing a smoky, butterscotchy overlay. Drink this soft, flamboyant wine now.',\n",
       " 'The Lange Twins are longtime growers in Lodi who also make their own wine, with the help of former Woodbridge winemaker David Akiyoshi. This Bordeaux blend is mostly Petit Verdot and Cabernet, with smaller amounts of Merlot and Malbec in the mix. The time this spent aging in French oak shows through in its minty, full mouthfeel and vanilla tannins.',\n",
       " \"Pear, pineapple and herb aromas intrigued some tasters, but others found an odd note in this wine's nose. Vanilla, pear, apple and sweet spices mark the medium-weight and round palate. The back end of this wine has tangy wood and a slight chalkiness.\",\n",
       " 'Attractive pear, citrus, melon and mild spice aromas open this lean and elegant wine. The mouthfeel is light, but not insubstantial and slightly tense (in a good way), showing good acid spine, crisp citrus flavors and taut mineral accents. A slight creaminess keeps it from getting too sharp, and it closes with a nice chalky note. Has the stuff to keep and may well merit a higher score with a few years of aging.',\n",
       " 'One of the workhorses on the J. Lohr “farm,” the Seven Oaks Cabernet is hugely successful in restaurants because of its accessible pricing and style. Its soft tannins, ripe fruit and slightly herbal edge go perfectly with grilled beef and lamb.',\n",
       " 'Lovely, sweet plummy fruit, leads into a soft, rich, mouth-pleasing wine. Beautiful bouquet, tons of flavor in an elegant style. Leafy, old-viney finish.',\n",
       " 'Stylish, precise, elegant and evocative, the Jessie may be the best of an excellent single-vineyard lineup from Cristom in 2009. Light toast rims deep black-fruit flavors, with excellent concentration. The lengthy finish brings in streaks of espresso and clean earth. This has the balance and detail to reward significant cellaring.',\n",
       " \"Warm summer weather ripened the grapes to black cherry and cocoa perfection, while cool nights preserved vital acidity. The oak tastes new and is in full balance with the wine's size. Despite a touch of raisins, this wine should hold and improve for five years before gradually losing fruit.\",\n",
       " 'Soft and sweet, with canned apricot and syrupy peach flavors.',\n",
       " \"This is a lean, acidic and disagreeable wine. It's unripe and minty, and even slightly vegetal, although there's just enough cherry-berry fruit to squeeze by.\",\n",
       " \"This is the richest bottling of Oppenlander that the winery has released, but it's also tannic, and needs time in the bottle to express itself. Dry and astringent, although with a silky texture, it shows cherry, pomegranate, red plum, anise and cola flavors. Best after 2011.\",\n",
       " 'Oregon Chardonnay in the low 12% alcohol range is well out of the ordinary, but it reflects the vintage conditions in 2010. This is a wine for acid lovers, with very tart green-apple fruit and a bit of spice.',\n",
       " \"Tastes sugary sweet in jammy lemons, tangerines and kiwi fruit, so if that's your thing, you'll like it. Brisk Central Coast acidity makes it bright and zesty.\",\n",
       " 'This wine comes from a vineyard planted in the early 2000s in the Sebastopol Hills by Charlie Chenoweth for the Jenkins family, a country music trio consisting of Nancy Jenkins and her two daughters. It is inviting and seductive in black cherry and baking spices. Tightly wound, it has nuance and a lingering afterthought of savory pepper and meat.',\n",
       " 'Very light, could almost be a rosé.',\n",
       " \"An interesting Chardonnay that will appeal to fans of French Chablis. It's completely dry and tart in acidity, and marked by flavors of stony, steely minerals. The fruit suggests lemon peel, enhanced with smoky oak and creamy lees. Elegant and sophisticated.\",\n",
       " \"The wine is close in quality to Dry Creek's spectacular single-vineyard '05 Zins, without quite the same power. Dry and softly tannic, it features flavors of blackberries, cherries, chocolate, cola and spice.\",\n",
       " 'Stainless steel-fermented, this bright, lively white wine has citrus, flower, date and apple flavors that finish on the sweet side.',\n",
       " 'This estate reserve wine has more texture and length than their regular estate Pinot Noir, and displays varietal flavors mixing rubarb, strawberry and raspberry preserves.  Some spicy herb adds life to the mid-palate, finishing with a bit of mint.',\n",
       " \"Fans of very fruity wines will enjoy this wine's candy jar of raspberries, cherries, ripe persimmons and pomegranate. It's delicious, although a bit too soft and melted, which makes it taste almost sweet.\",\n",
       " 'Feels unnaturally acidic, with an ultra-tart tang to the ripe cherries, cola and smoky cedar. Drink now.',\n",
       " \"This Two Blondes is the best ever—powerful and ripe, with a plush mix of raspberry and strawberry fruit, tart and tangy and mouthfilling. This wine has a huge midpalate, but doesn't stop there; as it slowly winds through a full-throttle finish, threads of chocolate, coconut, caramel and coffee appear. The flavors go on for several minutes.\",\n",
       " 'A delicious, balanced Pinot Noir. Shows dry, pure flavors of raspberries, cherries, cola and sandalwood, with a delicious, drink-me-now appeal.',\n",
       " 'Sanguine, this Merlot-dominant blend is juicy with well-toned structure and length. Smaller percentages of Syrah and Malbec provide succulence and softness, while also offering a density of black cherry and berry, finished in dark chocolate.',\n",
       " 'Beautifully perfumed with luscious stonefruit and a hint of jasmine blossoms, but not at all cloying, this off-dry Riesling is another favorite from Hermann J. Wiemer. Bouquets of white florals shower the palate as well, but then retreat in the midpalate allowing elegant mineral and lime flavors to shine through.',\n",
       " \"Winemaker Ron Bunnell ages this wine in 100% Hungarian oak, matching the powerful fruit flavors of plum, cassis and black cherry. There are suggestions of cola, and the vineyard's characteristically savory (umami) flavors of dried kelp and organic matter.\",\n",
       " \"A nice example of the '08 Pinots, just coming out, and the price is fair for a wine of this quality. Dry and silky, it shows good varietal flavors of cherries, cola, chocolate, sweet pomegranates and smoky oak, with a long, rich finish. Drink now.\",\n",
       " 'Freedom Hill is one of the most-admired vineyards in the Willamette Valley, and this elegant wine does it full justice. A beguiling mix of roses, chocolate, berry and sandalwood, it tickles the nose and tongue with its precision and deceptive depth of flavor.',\n",
       " \"A beautiful Chardonnay, creamy, dry and elegant. There's a tangy minerality underlying the rich tropical fruit, apple, pear and buttered toast flavors. This is an elegant and sophisticated wine from the Carneros region.\",\n",
       " 'Lusty and full-bodied, this dark-colored wine is deep in red, blue and black berry-cherry flavors, with additional complexities of milk chocolate, licorice, coconut macaroon and Kahlúa. Best of all is the structure that frames all this richness. The acid-tannin balance is polished and complex.',\n",
       " \"French-born Daniel Manies was the first cellarmaster at Opus One. Now he has his own winery. This inaugural Cab is plush and extremely soft to the point of melted. It's also seriously flavorful. It's like an ambrosiac nectar, all gooey blackberry pie filling and mocha vanilla cream. It's a good start.\",\n",
       " 'I tasted this alongside a Chard costing more than twice as much, and it held its own. The fruit, acids, oak, spice and creamy texture come together in an appealingly balanced package. Finishes dry, long and complex, but just a tad thin.',\n",
       " \"Dry and elegant, not really a rich wine, but a well-structured one. It has keen acids and dusty tannins that frame cola and root beer flavors. Give it a little decanting, since it's somewhat rigid right out of the bottle.\",\n",
       " 'A kitchen-sink blend of Chardonnay, Pinot Blanc, Sauvignon Blanc and Gewürztraminer, this wine showcases a rich combination of tropical fruit, pear and pink grapefruit with grassy overtones and just a hint of toast.',\n",
       " \"If only this blend of seven popular varieties were drier, it would score higher. It's crisp in acidity and complex in orange, peach, pear, honeysuckle, vanilla and mineral flavors. But the sugary finish puts it into the fruit juice category.\",\n",
       " 'Tons of fruit in this Cabernet, with oodles of blackberries and cherries, and the label is pretty. Missing a certain subtle complexity, but enough elegance remains to impress.',\n",
       " \"An absolutely lovely Pinot, the best in Gainey's long career. Dry, smooth and silky, it defines Pinot's more Burgundian side, with mushroomy notes along with perfectly ripe cherries and raspberries, accented with brilliant acidity. The oak treatment is tasteful and blends in seamlessly, offering a hint of toast. The wine treads an exciting line between ripeness and earthiness, while keeping alcohol to a refreshingly low 14.1%. This is a connoisseur's wine.\",\n",
       " 'Sweet in orange blossom and apricot flavors, with a good balance of acidity, this is a basic California late-harvest wine, satisfying due to its sweet fruit. Good with vanilla ice cream topped with peaches, with a sugar cookie.',\n",
       " \"Here's a pleasant, fruity, rich Bordeaux blend that impresses for its sheer wealth of flavor. Floods the mouth with blackberries, cherries, red and black currants and sweet, smoky oak, with firm but finely ground tannins. Feels direct and simple now, but that could be a function of youth. Try holding for 4–6 years and see where it goes.\",\n",
       " \"This small, Sonoma County-focused producer headed south to make a rich, attention-grabbing wine, with aromas of dark raspberries, blackberries, pulverized cloves, black sage and tobacco leaf. The palate shows smoked beef with cherry syrup, lifted by juniper and pine sap on the midpalate and boisterous acidity. It's distinctive yet not showy.\",\n",
       " \"There's a lot of oak on this Chard, sourced from multiple vineyards, and the barrel influences currently dominate, with the vanilla, butterscotch and caramel flavors many people confuse with the taste of Chardonnay itself. In this case, the underlying pineapple, pear and green apple fruit is ample enough to support all that weight.\",\n",
       " 'Violets and compost dance through the aromas, leading into an intensely fruity palate loaded with sappy berry richness, nuanced with scents and streaks of cured meat, garrigue, earth and graphite. Blending 77% Syrah with 23% Cabernet Sauvignon, it strikes a perfect balance among fruit, earth, and rock. At its core it is still wrapped tight, immaculately clean, and still almost impenetrably dense.',\n",
       " 'The aromas are herbal, flirting dangerously with green pepper before eventually settling somewhere between oregano and tea. The juicy black cherries on the palate compensate somewhat, and the oak is understated. Best with herb-laced beef or lamb to help accentuate the fruit.',\n",
       " \"This is a very good Cabernet that shows its mountain origins in the thick tannins and overall concentration. It's superrich in blackberries, black currants and crème de cassis, with a tangy minerality. There's also a cut of acidity that makes the mouthfeel tart, and will never go away. Seems at its best over the next few years for youthful beauty.\",\n",
       " 'Dry and sharp in acidity, with a tart mouthfeel, this Pinot also has some overripe flavors of raisins and bitter, tannic raisinskins. Seems like a problem at the sorting table. Decent, but not going anywhere.',\n",
       " 'A great success in 2008, this compelling Chardonnay offers concentrated, dense fruit flavors of lemon curd and sweet pineapple, along with streaks of vanilla cookie. Nuances reveal themselves through a lingering finish; fresh herb and hints of rock.',\n",
       " \"A blend of Bordeaux and Rhône varieties, this is a dry, somewhat rugged wine, whose best feature is fruit. Blackberries, cherries, plums, even cranberries and cocoa show up in the complex flavors. There's a tannic, acidic streak that makes it a little tough, though.\",\n",
       " 'Sharp in acids and a little green, this dry red wine tastes like an old-fashioned Chianti. The flavors are of red cherries, herbs and pepper. Made from 70% Sangiovese and Cabernet Franc.',\n",
       " 'This series of wines, under the Badger Mountain label of Powers winery, uses grapes that are organically grown. Minimal sulfites are added. This a fresh, forward, deliciously fruity Chardonnay, loaded with a classy mix of apple, pear and peach fruit. A great springtime sipper.',\n",
       " 'A blend of various Loring vineyards, this wine is soft and flamboyant in fruity flavor, and a little sweet in the finish, with dramatically ripe black cherry, chocolate and coffee flavors encased in soft, velvety but complex tannins. It defines the modern style of cool-climate California Pinot Noir allowed to achieve maximum ripeness.',\n",
       " \"Merry Edwards nailed this one. Lush and smooth as velvet, it shows enormously deep, ripe blackberry, cherry, raspberry, leather, cola, soy-splashed Portobello, vanilla and cinnamon spice flavors. But it's also a very young wine, to judge from the freshness of acids and tannins. Drink now, with decanting, and should age well for up to a decade.\",\n",
       " 'A bright, spritely single-vineyard wine with pleasant citrus, peach and honeysuckle flavors that finish with a white sugar aftertaste.',\n",
       " 'Aromas of marmalade, squeezed lime, red apple and apple blossoms hit the nose on this bottling from the Morgan Hill area producer. Ripe with Gala apple and pear flesh, the palate is also cut with lime juice and tangerine skin.',\n",
       " 'There is lots of fruity, oaky richness in this Cabernet, and acidity that is a bit aggressive. It shows opulent blackberry, raspberry, currant, dark chocolate and buttered toast flavors, which lead to a long, spicy finish. Drink up.',\n",
       " \"Notes of smoke, toast, lime and herbs play against guava, pear and brown sugar scents in the bouquet. A chalk note accents zesty orange, grapefruit and guava flavors and a soft mouthfeel. Vanilla, clove and oak highlights mark the wine's creamy, medium-length finish.\",\n",
       " \"Less jammy and forward than the '04 Elevage, but more closed and tannic than the winery's regular 2005 Cabernet, this Bordeaux blend really needs time to show its stuff. It has obviously deep and impressive currant and blackberry flavors, but the tannins are significant. Hold until at least 2010.\",\n",
       " \"Quite grassy and herbaceous, this is a Sauvignon Blanc for those who favor the tight, acidic-style of Loire valley versions. Citrus fruits and plenty of sharp acidity make this a wine to match with food, especially a nice goat cheese from the local farmers' market.\",\n",
       " \"Don't confuse this with the winery's regular Riesling, which is off-dry. This is their dry bottling, and it's a superior wine. Shows vital, crisp acidity that makes the mouth water, then follows up with rich citrus, green apple, Asian pear and peppery spice flavors that are tantalizing and complex. One of the more compelling dry Rieslings out there, but the 100-case production will make it hard to find.\",\n",
       " \"Shows an awful lot of wood, with vanilla and coconut notes dominating the blackberry fruit. The chewy tannins are omnipresent, but they're soft and lasting on the finish, giving us hope that this will evolve in a positive direction.\",\n",
       " 'Affordable and friendly, this refreshing wine offers strawberry jam and orange marmalade on the nose and a mineral-driven flavor profile. The fruit is overtaken by the acidity to some extent, but the wine still makes for a tasty warm weather sip.',\n",
       " 'This is Syrah. It has a classic Napa structure, with finely meshed tannins and soft acids, and has been treated with sweet, smoky oak. Needs to be drier, for the blackberry, currant, cherry and chocolate flavors finish with a sugary sweetness.',\n",
       " 'Shows real elegance and finesse in a variety that can sometimes get a little out of control. With smoothly polished tannins giving it a full-bodied mouthfeel, this single-vineyard wine has rich blackberry, black currant and pepper flavors. Fine now, and should develop for many years.',\n",
       " \"The 2005 Doyenne Aix is 50% Cabernet, 48% Syrah and 2% Mourvèdre. The increased percentage of Syrah and the extra dollop of Mourvèdre ramps this up to a stiffer, more substantial wine than the 2004. It's a Cabernet-driven complement to the DeLille D2, replete with muscle and nerve. Dark and chewy, the wine has picked up a little Rhône-like savage-ness from the Mourvèdre, especially in the aroma. The tannins are chewy and a bit leafy, and need some airing out, but there's plenty of meaty flavor here.\",\n",
       " 'This is a very rich Chardonnay. It has complex, lush flavors of pineapples, lemons, limes, oranges and the smoky vanilla notes from 100% new oak. High acidity fortunately provides crisp balance. Almost too much of a good thing, it calls for equally rich fare, such as lobster or Ahi tuna tartare.',\n",
       " 'Entirely off the estate, this polished young Pinot offers a complex mélange of flavors, in a balanced structure. The tastes of root beer, red currants, licorice, gingersnap cookie and sweet oak are frankly delicious. Fine now, and should peak by 2010, then hold for several more years.',\n",
       " \"While harmoniously dry on the palate, there's a fascinating interplay of sweet, candied orange peels and tea against darker tones of smoke and struck flint on this unusual Finger Lakes Riesling. Finishes quite brisk on a tart, raw quince note.\",\n",
       " 'This 100% Zin erupts in briary, peppery wild raspberry, blueberry and cherry flavors. The tannins are firm, and the acids crisp and savory. What a lovely Zinfandel, made in the soft, velvety style of Merlot, but with Bradford Mountain power.',\n",

       " 'A sexy, spicy oak character enlivens this full-bodied and supple-textured wine, standing out in the aroma and then mostly blending into ripe black cherry flavors on the palate. It has a firm, rather tannic texture, a feeling of richness, hints of cinnamon for complexity and a lingering finish.',\n",
       " 'Tart, tangy, and herbal, this juicy wine mixes cranberry and strawberry fruit with tomato leaf, herb and peppery spice. If new oak barrels were used, they are not showing themselves at the moment. But the balance, length and detail are delightful.',\n",
       " 'Hamacher is one of the founding members of the Oregon Chardonnay Alliance (ORCA), and this wine is a shining example of what heights Oregon Chardonnay can achieve.

       " \"Here's a big, rich, full-bodied Zin that calls for equally big foods, like tri-tip, barbecued ribs and Szechuan-style beef. Although it's extremely dry, it's fruity, with flavors of blackberries, mulberries and plums, accented with spices, sassafras and grilled meat.\",\n",
       " 'Heavy and full-bodied, a dense, soft Pinot Noir that seems too ripe for comfort. The cherry and currant flavors veer into raisins. The vineyard is from the warmest part of Russian River Valley, almost into Dry Creek Valley.',\n",
       " 'A delight to drink, with bright cherry and cola flavors nuanced with earthier tones of tobacco, rosehip tea and anise. The way the wine feels in the mouth is beautiful, all silk and satin. This balanced Pinot Noir defines elegance, and should improve for a few years.',\n",
       " \"Grown well inland, in a hot, arid part of the county, this Zin got superripe in the '07 vintage. It bursts with deep, rich flavors of blackberry pie filling, dark chocolate, anise and black pepper. The alcohol is extraordinarily high, approaching 16%, but there's really very little heat.\",\n",
       " \"Showcases a distinctive approach to Chenin that Clarksburg practically owns, which is to say, very dry, very acidic to the point of sour, with a flavor of grapefruit zest and tamarind seed. It's a simple but wholesome wine, and fills an important niche in California whites.\",\n",
       " 'Sweet, but thin in flavor, with modest orange, vanilla and buttercream notes. Pretty much all you get is sugar and alcohol. Mostly Sémillon, with some Muscat Canelli.',\n",

       " 'The extreme dryness and minerality at first give this wine a Chablis-like interest. Then you find lemons, limes and apricots, framed in acidity and herbs. Drink up.',\n",
       " 'A light mauve in color, this Pinot Noir-based wine shows boisterous plum fruit, macerated strawberries and a hint of clove on the ripe nose, making it more entrée-ready than apéritif-aimed. The palate offers strawberry and bubble-gum notes deftly hidden behind a veil of sour cherry and plum-skin tartness.',\n",
       " 'These are lighter, less ripe flavors—pomegranate, rhubarb, salmonberry—but nicely turned in this warm vintage. Some cinnamon spice sweetens the naturally earthy, green tea tannins.',\n",
       " 'This is taut, muscular, toasty, young and tight; the fruit is concentrated, pure and evocative, with earthy flavors that add notes of soil, spice and mineral. The most complex of all the Betz blends, in this vintage it includes 84% Cabernet Sauvignon—far and away the dominant flavor. The fruits unfold in a rich panoply of reds and blues; the tannins are rich and chewy, polished and complex, showing exemplary back of the palate grip and concentration.',\n",
       " 'A beautiful, rich, elegant, fancy sparkling wine. Feels so fine in the mouth, all silk and satin, with deep, dry raspberry, strawberry, vanilla, toast, yeasty lees, brioche and honey flavors. Superb, but young. Needs time. Give it until 2011, if you can keep your hands off, and should develop until 2015, if not longer.',\n",
       " 'Pretty good, but at this price, a bit heavy and over-extracted for a Pinot Noir, almost Grenache-like. The flavors are black peppery, with an underground stream of black cherries and oak, and the tannins close in on the finish.',\n",
       " \"Don't reject this Syrah, Petite Sirah and Cabernet blend because it's non-vintage. So are many great Champagnes. Made from the 2006 and 2007 vintages, it's absolutely delicious, so stuffed with blackberry, black currant and bacon flavors, you can't help but be impressed. It's also very young and fresh in acids and tannins, so give it a year or two in order to knit together.\",\n",
       " \"Long known for their powerful, elegant Chardonnays, Chalk Hill's 1998 offering is impressive for its complex array of aromas and flavors. The toasty, leesy, popcorn elements adorn full, richly nuanced sweet pear, pineapple and peach flavors. A lovely, smooth mouthfeel with a slight granular quality adds texture and interest. This refined wine exudes finesse and refinement.\",\n",
       " \"Deeper and darker than the Estate bottling, this shows black cherry, meat and leather nuances. It's sexy, but a touch hot as well. Offers depth and complexity, especially on the finish, where interesting chocolate notes emerge.\",\n",
       " \"This may be a second wine to Laurel Glen's fabulous '02 estate Cab, but it can hold its head high in any gathering. It's soft and rich, with lovely varietal cassis, milk chocolate and smoky oak flavors that finish with a savory cut of anise. Fine now, and should hold for several years.\",\n",
       " \"A really nice Merlot, and look at that price. It's dry, elegant and entirely balanced, with a rich earthy texture. Shows classic flavors of black cherries, black currants, violets, anise and sweet sandalwood. Terrific value.\",\n",
       " \"Dark, bitterly dry and mouth-puckeringly tannic, this is not a wine for those looking for immediate hedonistic pleasure. Although extensive decanting and big, rich meats and cheeses will help, it's really built for the cellar. Should hold and soften for 20 years.\",\n",
       " \"High-toned, with somewhat muted fruit – waxy comes to mind – yet with appealing softness and immediate drinkability. It's non-vintage, a blend of two Cabernets, Merlot and Syrah, streaked with vanilla.\",\n",
       " \"Nice black cherry and black currant fruit flavors are wrapped in a casing of stone and earth. This wine seems to be holding itself back, perhaps just in need of further cellaring, certainly requiring decanting. It's compact, elegant and well balanced, but shy.

       " \"Lovely texture, a smooth but slightly astringent tannic base, good acid and a hint of citrus that lifts and refreshes. It doesn't seem to have the complexity or the sheer power of the 2002 L'Orage, but it's well made and appealing. Flavors of strawberry, raspberry, red cherry, and blueberry carry it.\",\n",
       " \"This is easily Cuvaison's best Pinot Noir ever. It's not only delicious right out of the bottle, it's an ager. Really flatters the palate with appealing cherry, black raspberry, cola and tangerine fruit, wrapped in a silky texture. Yet it shows a dense, tightly tannic quality that suggest up to 8 years in the cellar.\",\n",
       " 'Dark and fairly big for a Pinot, almost Grenache-like in its weight and full-bodied mouthfeel. Tastes rich in cherry pie with the crust, blackberry jam, licorice, bacon, cola and black pepper. Dry and luscious, but a bit muscular now. Needs time, and should improve by 2012.',\n",
       " \"Soft and superripe, with flavors of red currants and dried orange peel. Although the wine is fully dry, there's something Porty about it.\",\n",
       " 'The four-decade-old vines have lent this wine unusual flavors of forest mushroom, lemon rind and verbena. It tastes completely dry, and it has a tartness that carries through the palate. Drink this with herb-roasted chicken or pasta primavera.',\n",
       " \"There's no other blend of Carignan, Pinot Noir, Gewürz, Syrah and several other varieties, so far as I know. The wine is dry, with crisp acidity and deep cherry and raspberry flavors. It's not complicated, but it's fun.\",\n",
       " \"There's a good wine in here, but it needs some time to escape the cage of hard tannins and primary fruit. Floods the mouth with blackberry pie, crème de cassis and sweet, vanilla oak flavors that are just itching for a good 5–7 years in the cellar.\",\n",
       " \"Despite the extra bottle age, it's a very youthful, dense wine. The Malbec is battened down with spicy purple fruit flavors and compact tannins. The balance is acid-driven, and the presence of new oak is muted. Will the tannins soften before the fruit fades? It's worth socking a bottle or two away to find out.\",\n",
       " \"Tastes a bit tired, with apricot and pineapple flavors that are losing their fruity flesh, showing herbal bones. Dry and crisp, it's unlikely to improve with further age.\",\n",
       " \"100% Wallula Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon, this first vintage from Den Hoed was held for almost a full nine years before its release. It shows its age with dried cherries and raisins accented by medicine cabinet notes. The palate is in full bloom with rich, rounded flavors and chalky tannins leading to a cranberry filled finish. For people interested in seeing what aged wine tastes like, they've done the work for you here.\",\n",
       " \"Raspberries, cherries, cola, exotic spices and sweet cedar mark the flavors of this Pinot Noir. It's elegant in the mouth, with brisk acidity, but also a distinct earthiness. The combination gives the wine a yin-yang of weight and weightlessness. It's too young to properly enjoy now, so drink from 2019 and beyond.\",\n",
       " 'This single-vineyard Chard with no oak has a light bouquet with nuances of white florals and red apple. The palate offers more heft and concentration with flavors of peach preserves and clementine supremes. Lower alcohol with a medium-length finish; rich and tasty without being overdone.',\n",
       " 'Very sweet but a bit thin on fruity flavor despite some chocolate and raspberry. This Port-style wine is a blend of Primitivo, Zinfandel and Syrah.',\n",
       " 'Chards are tight, acidic and minerally in youth, showing a lees-infused structure but offering waves of complexity. With toasty oak, the base flavors are of nectarines, mangoes, peaches, zesty green apples and dustings of Asian spice.',\n",
       " \"This is the winery's sweet bubbly, and it will appeal to fans of sweet wines. The orange, vanilla and honeysuckle flavors are delicious and easy. The blend is Flora, Gewürztraminer and Pinot Noir.\",\n",
       " \"Believe me, you won't miss the oak barrel influence on this wine. It's so good all by itself. Brightened with crisp Monterey acidity and totally dry, it's rich in pineapple, tangerine, Meyer lemon, lime, mineral and vanilla flavors that will satisfy your Chardonnay tooth.\",\n",
       " 'This blend of 87% Grenache and 13% Syrah shows red apple, deep strawberry and yeast touches on the fresh and lively nose. It hits the palate with brilliant, tactile energy, delivering rounded red fruit and bubblegum flavors that make it a certain summertime crowd pleaser.',\n",
       " \"Enticingly nutty on the nose, with hints of smoke, yeast and apricot kernel, this 2003 vintage bottling from Swedish Hill shows promising signs of development. While fairly aggressive on the attack, it's clean and lemony on the palate, with a softly saline, sea breeze note on the finish.\",\n",
       " \"The Block 23 vineyard consists of Pommard-clone Pinot Noir. The resultant wine keeps a tight focus on lovely raspberry and cherry flavors. Ample acidity supports the fruit, giving it a crisp, clean and fresh mouthfeel. It's racy, lightly spicy, and beautifully balanced.\",\n",
       " \"A lovely Cabernet, rich and pure and quite frankly delicious. Although it shows those famous mountain tannins, they're softly refined and entirely drinkable now, letting the blackberry, chocolate, violet and mineral flavors come through.\",\n",
       " \"Very sweet and delicious, a true Port-style wine that's high in acidity and packed with tannins. But the sugar level is so high, it makes the wine drinkable now. The flavors are of chocolate, red currants and vanilla.\",\n",
       " \"If you're looking for a truly bone-dry Riesling from the Finger Lakes, look no further than Ravines. It's uncharacteristically austere for the region, with a lean, light body and a mineral laden, wet-stone palate. Lots of freshly squeezed lime juice and a citrus rind finish makes this an elegant, drinkable choice.\",\n",
       " 'Cheval and Champoux. Snappy and crisply defined, this sharp-edged wine opens with tight berry flavors, some chalky acids, and grainy, stony tannins. It shows less flesh than the other reds, more acid, and a stiffness to the tannins. After extensive airing the vanilla flavors come out, along with an interesting spice. The fruit is clean and ripe, and the balance, except possibly for the chalky acids, is right on.',\n",
       " \"A little heavy and overripe. There's a taste of prunes and chocolate in addition to the more classic cherries. Nicely dry and complex, but lacks vibrancy. Drink now.\",\n",
       " \"A spicy, chewy, rustic wine marked by crusty tannins and wild berry and raisin flavors. It's also totally dry, at the cost of high alcohol, which is 15.7% and gives it a burn on the finish. In its own way, classic country-style Foothills Zin, brawny and strong.\",\n",
       " 'As with many of the Erath 2010 vineyard designates, this is strongly herbal. The notes of leaf and herb create somewhat unripe flavor impressions, with a touch of bitterness on the finish. The fruit just passes the ripeness of sweet tomatoes.',\n",

       " \"Garnet long has been one of California's greatest entry-level Pinot Noirs, and it still is. Maybe the best. The '09 reflects the balanced vintage. It's a dry, silky, light-bodied wine, with pretty raspberry and cola flavors.\",\n",
       " \"Io has a really good track record with this Syrah, which is grown in Paso Robles. The '06 is intricately structured, a dry wine with complex flavors of blackberries, currants, dates, mocha, leather, grilled meat, pepper and vanilla. Hard to resist drinking it now, but it should evolve in interesting ways over the next six years.\",\n",
       " \"This 100% Syrah needs to breathe and open; it's nicely melded but subdued. It shows hints of gamy, meaty, wild herb undertones, plenty of acid, tart fruit and berry.\",\n",
       " 'Tough, acidic and tight in youth, offering little in the way of richness. So tart, so minerally, so dry. A wine that demands time in the cellar. Should reward the patient after six years or so, to allow things to resolve so the cherry, cranberry and rhubarb flavors can transmogrify. It would not be surprising for this wine to develop bottle nuance for well more than a decade.',\n",
       " \"This prototypical Walla Walla mutt red is half Cabernet Sauvignon and the rest a mix of Syrah, Merlot, Cab Franc, Sangiovese and even a bit of Carmenère. Lush, fruity and forward, it's got a little bit of everything going for it flavorwise as well: berries, cherries, cassis, coffee, chocolate, vanilla bean and cinnamon. All good stuff, schmoozed together and thoroughly delicious.\",\n",
       " 'This tastes sweeter than the very fine 2009 and 2010, but that may be because the fruit is so powerfully intense and pure. It has flavors of ripe tangerines, limes, peaches and apples, made racy by its acidity. No oak has been applied, so the wine tastes fresh.',\n",
       " 'Supple and muscular, with appealing bacon fat aromas, this round and spicy effort. A tightness in the midpalate suggests that further bottle age is in order.',\n",
       " 'Ripe, juicy and simple, with blackberry-infused espresso flavors that finish with some sweetness.',\n",
       " 'Spicy and fruity and, as the label says, dry. It shows crisp acids and a bright, delicately clean mouthfeel. Kind of like a Sauvignon Blanc except for the exotic tropical fruit and Asian spice flavors.',\n",
       " \"Great price for a wine of this complexity and satisfaction. It's dry and crisp in acidity, with a wealth of lemon, lime and grapefruit citrus flavors and richer notes of peach pie and yellow apricot purée. Almost seems underpriced for what you get.\",\n",
       " \"Loaded with ripe peaches and apricots, honey and jasmine, this was picked at 42 brix and is technically an ice wine though not labeled such. It's just this side of syrupy, but quite luscious and silky smooth.\",\n",
       " 'This first label Merlot combines pleasant notes of black coffee and plush red plum with savory aromas of dried mushrooms, spices and a hint of tomatoes. Gripping tannins and glimpses of underripe fruit and green stalks throughout make this wine a tad clunky and disjointed.',\n",
       " 'The wine itself, underneath all the wood, is light and silky and not particularly rich, with flavors of cherries. What tastes like heavy oak barrel layering plasters on vanilla, caramel and buttercream notes, resulting in an awkward Merlot.',\n",
       " 'With its slightly sweet orange, pear, green apple, honeysuckle and vanilla flavors, this will appeal to the Moscato-sipping crowd. The bubbles make for easy fun. A blend of Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Muscat, Riesling and Gewürztraminer.',\n",
       " \"An effusively flowery, honeyed wine, brimming with bright aromas of butterscotch and smoke, apricots, vanilla and cinnamon. It's exotically fruity and rich, with complex flavors ranging from apricot preserves to ginger. Tasty on its own.\",\n",
       " \"This Rhône blend, which is based on Grenache, has bright red cherry, orange zest and vanilla flavors, accented with caramelized oak. It's a little on the sweet side, but balanced with vital acidity.\",\n",
       " \"Cedarville's estate-grown, Priorat-inspired blend of 45% Grenache, 30% Syrah and 25% Cabernet Sauvignon, is well made and inclined to age. It's still soft and oaky with a hint of leathery cassis and game. Imagine a Spanish fiesta for this food-friendly wine.\",\n",
       " \"Ultrarich in cherry, black raspberry and red currant flavors, with a savory note of grilled beef and the sweet, salty umami of bacon. New oak brings vanilla bean and caramel richness. The result is a strongly flavored wine, but it's balanced with fine acidity. Drink now.\",\n",
       " \"Here's a young, hedonistic Pinot that captures the essence of RRV from a perfect vintage. Although it's ripely forward in cherry, pomegranate, Dr. Pepper, red licorice and cinnamon spice flavors, it shows a structural sophistication that elevates the score. Beautiful now, and should improve over the next 6 years.\",\n",
       " 'Creamy on the nose with a scent of musk and flowers, this wine from Brotherhood is too angular to fully enjoy. The acidity is good but the overall flavors are lean.',\n",
       " 'Lower in alcohol and more elegant than most Santa Rita Pinot Noirs, this beauty has succulent cherry fruit flavors grounded in earthier notes of tobacco, dried herbs and black pepper. Good now, but should improve after 2011.',\n",
       " 'Tasty hazelnut overtones to the apple and cinnamon aromas mark the nose of this elegant wine. Toasted almond, pear and caramel flavors work in harmony. Good acidity and all-around stylish restraint make it a great food wine.',\n",
       " \"This is a dry, clean, crisp Roussanne wine whose dominant flavors are of oranges and apricots. Oak brings additional notes of vanilla and buttered toast. It's a good, elegant wine to try as an alternative to Chardonnay.\",\n",

       " \"The aroma suggests a ton of oak, and that impression carries over to the flavors. Butterscotch, buttered toast, caramel, crème brûlée, they're all tasty, but you don't want them to dominate, and here, they do. The underlying flavors of pineapples are swamped.\",\n",
       " 'The appellation is in San Benito County, a terroir that has plenty of coastal influence.

Try as an interesting alternative to Sauvignon Blanc or Viognier.',\n",
       " \"Tough in acids and tannins, with a gritty mouthfeel. Although the blackberry, black currant and cedar flavors are very rich and pure, the wine's aggressiveness interferes with its enjoyment. Doesn't seem likely to improve with age.\",\n",

The York Mountain AVA is in a cooler, hilly part of western Paso Robles, wide open to Pacific influence, and you can taste the salty sea breeze in the crisp acidity and fine tannins, not to mention the white pepper flavors that give a piquant spiciness to the blackberries and mocha.

       " 'Pretty tannic, and extremely well-oaked. Char, vanilla and smoke dominate the opening aroma, only gradually revealing underlying cassis flavors. In the mouth, the wine is tannic and young, but the solid core of cherry-berry suggests aging until 2008.',\n",
       " \"Soft and approachable, with little evidence (in the mouth) of the 15.6% alcohol listed on the label, this is a pleasant, rather generically flavored red.

       " 'Just 38 cases produced. The fruit is sourced from the Seven Hills vineyards, and the blend is a “super-Walla-Wallan” with 60% Sangiovese, 20% Cabernet Sauvignon and 20% Cab Franc. Light and somewhat unfocused, it has some characteristic high tones, a suggestion of anise and a bit of toasty oak in the finish.',\n",
       " \"A bit too tart, and the cherry flavors have hints of sweetened green tomato pie. It's a very good, drily crisp and interesting wine, but could be a touch lusher, although oak goes a long way to add richness.\",\n",
       " \"This Napa stalwart is beautifully integrated. Leesy and citrus notes accent the solid apple and toast profile on both the nose and in the mouth.

       " 'First to arrive, straight to your awaiting nose, are complex aromatics, with a mix of floral and spicy highlights that surround the black and purple fruits with exotic nuances. The fruit is nigh perfect—ripe, round, forward and loaded with plummy, sweet berries. It gathers strength in the core, holds, and then expands into a finish dusted with cocoa and coffee.',\n",
       " 'This is a clean, oaky and fairly simple Chardonnay. It satisfies the basic varietal requirements, with pineapple tart, buttered toast and cinnamon spice flavors. From Testarossa.',\n",
       " \"This is a Cab-based Bordeaux blend, and it shows Paso's ability to produce a ripe, gentle red wine that's immediately appealing. There's a nice earthiness to the cassis flavors, and a rich, tannic structure that makes you dream of a perfectly broiled steak or chop, brushed with brown butter sauce with a touch of garlic.\",\n",
       " \"Made in a big, ripe style, this is Gypsy Canyon's best Pinot Noir in years, but it will require some time in the cellar to soften.

It has all the elements of fine Russian River Pinot—it's dry and has lots o f ripe fruit, pretty oak, toast and spice—and it puts them all together in a super-elegant package. The vintage is light but the wine doesn't seem to mind. Its class shows. `\",\n",

It rounds out nicely in the midpalate, and continues cleanly into a rather crisp finish, with a suggestion of rye or caraway as a final note.',\n",
       " 'Aromatic, chocolaty and deliciously smooth, the Sheridan vineyard bottling sends up sweet scents of ground coffee and chocolate. Compact fruit flavors of fig and black cherry run right into a bourbon barrel finish, with granular tannins that add welcome texture and a streak of graphite.',\n",

       " 'This is 62% Cabernet Sauvignon and 38% Syrah. The Cab shines here, firm and confident, with sharp edges from spicy herbs. The fruit is polished and silky, and the wine seems to have a sheen over it, an almost gauze-like surface that shimmers and shines.',\n",
       " \"Rich and dramatic, if a little overworked. It's superripe in pineapple and orange jam fruit, with a strong application of sweet oak that layers vanilla and buttered toast. Brings Chardonnay to its ultimate deliciousness, but would benefit from greater nuance. Drink now.\",\n",

       " 'Crushed chalk and wax notes add a striking minerality to this delicately framed, semisweet Riesling. A juicy wine, it offers an abundance of ripe stone-fruit and citrus flavors, with an earthen, waxy slick that lingers on the finish.',\n",
       " 'One of the most instantly delicious Pinots of the vintage. Comes from the northern, warmer part of the valley, and shows perfectly ripe fruit flavors of cherries, cranberries and Dr. Pepper, made richer with sweet smoky oak. Should hold in the bottle for 4–5 years.',\n",
       " \"Bottled at 18% residual sugar, this wine's most delicious quality is its fabulously rich sweetness, almost decadent in pale honey and apricot jam. Acidity is just fine, but what the wine needs is greater depth of fruity flavor.\",\n",
       " 'An interesting and even somewhat eccentric wine. There are notes of green tea and herbs, but enough pure orange fruit to make it rich. Lots of zingy acidity, too.',\n",
       " 'This is a strongly flavored wine with flavors of fresh pineapples, limes, lemons and vanilla. It has a tangy taste of minerals that grounds it. As fruity as it is, it finishes fully dry. Good now with Asian-inspired fare.',\n",
       " \"A juicy, plump wine that's filled with fun flavors, among them blackberry, mocha, vanilla and dark candied cherries. The tannins are soft; the acidity just fine. Don't turn your nose up because of the price, or because you think Monterey and Cabernet don't mix. This is a darned good value. Best Buy.\",\n",
       " \"The most notable thing about this Pinot is its intensity of flavor. A blend of both new Dijon clones and older California selections of Pinot Noir, it is stunning with flavors of raspberries, cherries and Dr. Pepper.

       " 'A beautiful, polished Pinot Noir that offers loads of flavor, while preserving the vital acidity that keeps the wine fresh and balanced. Cherries, raspberries, root beer, vanilla, cinnamon and smoky sandalwood flood the mouth, wrapped into a silky texture. Drink now through 2013.',\n",
       " \"Though not as ripe or potent as the leading Boushey Vineyard Syrahs, this delicate wine is nicely balanced and reasonably complex, showing light pepper along with tart cherry- and berry-flavored fruit. There's plenty of acid, but the fruit is ripe enough to avoid the sour-candy label.\",\n",
       " 'Quite a beautiful, lush Syrah, and one that goes a long way to restoring faith in this long under-performing appellation. Dry and soft, the wine offers rich flavors of cassis, melted dark chocolate, leather, vanilla and anisette, with a pleasantly spicy edge of black pepper. Drink now.',\n",
       " 'Quite an impressive wine, especially from this prestigious appellation at this price. Dry and full-bodied, it shows black cherry candy, currant, herb, anise and cedar flavors, wrapped into finely ground, dusty tannins.

       " 'This attractively priced wine has nice acidity and subtle flavors of pear and lemon. A pronounced swaddling in oak reveals itself on the nose and mid-palate. Enjoy it with food on the richer side.',\n",
       " 'Better known for red wines, Hendry often produces a very good Chardonnay. This 2010 shows fine acidity and sweet flavors of tropical fruit, vanilla and buttered toast.',\n",
       " \"Charbonneau is Woodward Canyon's proprietary name for its white and red blended wines. The blanc is predominantly Sémillon, with 10% Sauvignon Blanc added to round it out. The nose is scented with freshly mown hay, spice and herbs. It has plenty of crisp fruit in the mouth, and a distinctive spiciness that begs to be paired with Thai food,  crab cakes or something with cilantro. Great food wine.\",\n",
       " 'Tastes of perfectly ripened pineapple, pear, lime and peach flavors. On the structural side is fine acidity and a tangy minerality, like a lick of cold steel. Oak is here, notable but perfectly integrated. Give this Chard a little time in the glass to breathe.',\n",
       " \"After missing a beat in '04, the '05 reverts to the high quality of the '03. Made from Dijon clones, the wine shows a brilliant purity of cherry fruit, with rich, earthy complexities of mushrooms, forest floor, cola and balsam. Bone dry, it has an elegantly silky quality that cries out for the best foods. Best now and for the next four years.\",\n",
       " 'Subtle aromas of freshly cut grass and crisp Asian pears make this clean, dry Riesling a refreshing sipping wine. A tingly acidity and citrus pith notes linger playfully on the palate.',\n",

       " 'Right now this wine is strutting its stuff, showing dense, fudge-like scents of tobacco, cassis and whiffs of vanilla and coconut and flavors of blackberry with lashings of vanilla and cocoa. But like many vintages of Montelena, expect this one to shut down in another year only to reemerge as a beauty around age 10 or 12. Another classic.',\n",
       " 'Made in a more extracted, fuller style, this is overwhelmingly earthy and intensely aromatic. Its time in oak has not quite shaken off entirely, and its fruit expression veers on the darker side, with notes of black cherries and blueberries standing out the most. An herbal aura lingers around.',\n",
       " 'Lush and decadent, this wine has blackberry and blueberry jam, milk chocolate and toasty oak flavors. And even with all of the richness, the finish is dry and tannic. The gripping tannins suggest it can age for for 5–6 years.',\n",

It's a complex wine, which, despite its youth, shows a wonderful range of flavors, from black cherry to coffee to steel and smoke. The iron and acids and tannin are there to age, but it drinks beautifully right now, so why wait? Just 138 cases made.\",\n",
       " \"This is pure Cabernet from one of Washington's oldest vineyards. Cold Creek is a hot site, and its grapes are scattered throughout many of the Ste. Michelle brands, often providing the core fruit. Here is the essence, a wine that opens a bit grudgingly, but has structure and concentration if you take the time to let it blossom. Dense cherry and cassis fruit is tightly wound with balancing acids. The use of new oak is restrained, but sufficient, and this is a wine that should age nicely for many years.\",\n",

It's a full-bodied, sappy wine, forward and plump, and the deep core of blackberry fruit is enhanced with pepper, citrus peel, clove and other spices. Young and still grapey, it's delicious right now but can be cellared for some years.\",\n",
       " \"A clumsy wine. While there's some good blackberry fruit, the mouthfeel is sharp and edgy, suggesting green stems and pips resulting in hard tannins. Doesn't seem likely to age out.\",\n",
       " \"Weedy and acidic, this Cabernet has very modest flavors of blackberries and currants. The sharpness will not go away with aging. It's an okay wine, but badly in need of greater richness.\",\n",
       " \"A classic Petite Sirah. Dark, dry, densely layered and very tannic, it's a wine that should easily glide over the next decade. Shows a concentrated heart of blackberries, black pepper and smoked butter notes from oak barrel aging.\",\n",
       " \"This wonderfully rich wine combines the best of all three varieties to produce a complex white. It shows rich green apple, pineapple jam, superripe apricot, honeysuckle and smoky oak flavors, and while it's tremendously honeyed on the finish, it is basically dry. Crisp acidity, probably from the Carneros Chardonnay, provides needed balance.\",\n",
       " 'This is the kind of Chardonnay that divides wine lovers into enemy camps. Old World purists will criticize the candied richness. New World fans will love the toasted marshmallow, caramel corn and buttered toast flavors that rest on a solid foundation of pineapple and green apple fruit.',\n",
       " \"Cab Franc is the main grape here, and it generates an even darker, more leafy and earthy companion to the winery's other Cab. The tannins are smoky and granular, with lots of coffee and stem flavors. But as always, the winemaking is excellent, the balance impeccable, and the grapes have been very carefully managed. The fruit, though tart and tight, is there, with cassis and purple plum flavors dominant.\",\n",
       " \"The grapes sure got ripe even in this cool, balanced vintage, so that the wine is jammy in cherry, black raspberry and cola flavors. It's delicious and crisply elegant, with a silky texture, but a little direct and forward. Probably at its best now.\",\n",
       " \"A wonderfully dry, minerally Sauvignon Blanc. It's set off by crisp acidity, and has rewarding flavors of lemons, grapefruits and limes, enriched with pineapples, figs and honeysuckle.\",\n",
       " 'Dry, silky and crisp in acidity, this Pinot offers easy flavors of red cherries, cola, licorice, orange zest and cedar, with a vast array of peppery spices. At its best now.',\n",
       " \"Made from mostly Syrah and Cabernet Sauvignon, this is a compelling wine to drink now. It exudes concentrated flavors of raspberry and cherry that taste like they have been baked in pie crust and sprinkled with baking spice. Notes of bacon, licorice and sandalwood add further complexity. The structure is superb, with citrusy acids and supple tannins. All profits from the sale of this wine go to Jonata's vineyard crew.\",\n",
       " \"This simple Chardonnay is soft and sweet, with some vanilla oaky notes. It's made in the popular style.\",\n",
       " 'Pessagno has a perfect track record with this cool-climate vineyard, consisently producing Chards of this caliber. The wine is tight in acids and flinty minerals, even showing new oaky tannins. But the exotic nuances of roasted peaches and grilled pineapples suggest cellarability. Best after 2008.',\n",
       " \"Freshly acidic and jammy in blackberry, cherry and raspberry flavors, this is one of the fruitier Napa Cabs available. It's at its best now, so drink up with a nice steak.\",\n",
       " \"The color is deeper and darker than average. Aromas are like superripe plums, while flavors resemble sweet plums and blackberries. It's a generous and smooth wine that's not deep in flavor, but pleasant and easy to enjoy.\",\n",
       " 'Very, very sweet in residual sugar, with powerful flavors of apricots, honey, oranges and vanilla. A bit soft, but the luscious sweetness is what makes it work.',\n",
       " \"This is Côtes-du-Rhône, California style. A blend of Grenache, Mourvedre, Syrah and Counoise, it's a dry, rich, full-bodied red wine, flooded with easy-to-drink cherry, blackberry, blueberry and oak flavors, and a wealth of Provençal rosemary, lavender and thyme. Drink now for its soft, youthful purity.\",\n",
       " 'Everything has come together in this polished, approachable wine. The tannins are brisk but sweetly ripe. Oak has been fully integrated, lending smoky vanilla to the cherry and licorice flavors. Crisp Carneros acidity makes everything bright and shiny. Enjoy this Pinot now through 2010, as it gradually loses fruit.',\n",
       " \"A lovely, crisp, light wine that's not really dry, but nearly so. Has finely detailed citrus and wildflower aromas and flavors, and good acidity.\",\n",
       " \"This is a big, very fruity Syrah. It's almost over the top, blasting the palate with blackberry and cherry jam, blueberry tart, black currant and chocolate flavors. But then the tannins kick in, offering structural balance. Drink now.\",\n",
       " 'In this gold-colored wine, green-apple skin and nutmeg-ginger spice wrap around a full-bodied build, with a preponderance of ripe peach within its makeup too. Decadent, and nutty from the oak, it brings a fulsomeness of crème brûlée to the finish.',\n",
       " 'Vista Hills is in a sweet spot in the Dundee Hills, with neighbors including DDO and Domaine Serene. This puts the fruit front and center, a panoply of berries and melon, lightly edged with toast. Warm, forward and palate-friendly, it rolls into a finish with a hint of sassafras.',\n",
       " 'A good, not great, Pinot Noir from Clos du Val. The wine is entirely dry and fairly full-bodied, with a tannic astringency that brings to mind cherry skins, apple skins and rhubarb. The winemaker suggests aging.',\n",
       " \"This wine, from the Parker vineyard in Santa Ynez Valley, shows the voluptuous mouthfeel that's made Syrah so popular. The flavors are of the ripest blackberries cooked into a tart, and then sprinkled with butter, vanilla, cocoa and cinnamon. How good is that? A pointed reminder that high alcohol does not necessarily equal heat.\",\n",
       " 'Fresh apples with hints of butterscotch, toast and smoke perfume this lovely Chardonnay. While a tad short in concentration, this medium-bodied wine is wonderfully fresh and clean on the palate, with beautifully balanced oak and bright acidity on the finish.',\n",
       " 'A very nice, super-drinkable Chardonnay marked by brisk, cool-climate acidity and a bracing minerality. The pineapple, peach and apple flavors have the slight herbality you often find in Napa Chardonnay.',\n",
       " 'Made from Roussanne and Viognier, this Rhône white blend is simple and slightly sweet. It has jellied apricot, pineapple and honey flavors.',\n",
       " \"Sausal has some of the oldest vines in Sonoma County, and despite ripe raspberry, blackberry, cola and chocolate flavors, this wine has a taste of the earth that must come from the vine roots reaching deep into the soil. It's a lovely, gentle Zinfandel for drinking now.\",\n",
       " \"Off in quality from previous vintages, Bell's '04 Bordeaux blend has a naggingly weedy, chlorophyll edge to the cherry and blackberry flavors. It's not going anywhere in the cellar.\",\n",
       " \"Dripping in earth, kir and fresh raspberry, this is a stellar wine from the heart of the appellation, estate-grown from a four-acre spot planted to a trio of clones. Spirited and refreshing, it dances in acidity and a floral back note that's compelling, wrapped in cinnamon and mocha.\",\n",
       " 'Young and spicy, with deeply-etched cranberry fruit flavors, limned with leafy herbal tannins. The core of fruit is pretty as can be, and the nicely-managed tannins wrap it in a perfect frame, while giving it added muscle. Another two or three years in the bottle will really bring this into focus.',\n",
       " 'A sound, everyday Sauvignon Blanc. It has ripe citrus fruit flavors that are jammy sweet, with crisp acidity.',\n",
       " 'Spicy, toasty and dense, this 47% Merlot, 30% Cabernet Sauvignon, 13% Cab Franc and 10% Malbec blend is packed with berry and cassis fruits. Young and persistent, it runs through the bright luscious raspberries into a deeper layer of stone and licorice. Beautifully defined, with a panorama of red and black fruits and excellent persistence.',\n",
       " 'Light in body, and very dry and silky, this is an elegantly structured Pinot Noir. It shows modest, but clean, flavors of cherries, black raspberries, cocoa and vanilla. Drink now.',\n",
       " 'The Aviator Red is a well-crafted blend that mixes strawberry, raspberry, pepper and stone in an effective balance that seems to draw the best from each grape. For a modest, everyday wine, this works quite well.',\n",
       " \"Dry and focused in acids, the wine shows the balance and complexity of the vineyard, as well as its ageworthiness. It's very young now, with immature raspberry, cola, rum punch, balsamic, mushroom and Asian spice flavors, but decanting and slow warming in the glass help elevate it. Nonetheless, your best bet is the cellar. Best after 2008, and for many years after, depending on how old you like your wines.\",\n",
       " \"This is a fresh, vibrant stainless steel-fermented Chard that boasts charming notes of fresh apple slices, nectarine, lemon rind citrus and a hint of yellow florals. It's ripe and big without being too spicy or overdone, with a solid, lengthy finish. Drink now.\",\n",
       " 'Big and bold, a ripe, oaky Chardonnay that needs some time in the cellar to come together. Offers tiers of apricot, pear, peach and nectarine flavors, with a stony minerality and crisp acidity that makes the mouth water. Bone dry and complex, this Chablisian Chardonnay will blossom some time in 2010.',\n",
       " 'How astonishing to find an Oregon Pinot Noir just under 13% alcohol that is fully ripe and fragrant with a perfect balance of fruit, herb and mineral. The young raspberry fruit flavors and overall lightness of this wine match beautifully with lox or smoked salmon. Despite its elegance, this strikes me as a wine that could turn out to be quite long-lived, given its impeccable balance.',\n",
       " \"Strikes a nice balance between fat, rich, decadently ripe raspberry and date fruit, with a drink-me-now appeal, and a more serious undertow of tannins, mushrooms and pine. Give it a good decant, and focus on what's going on in the glass.\",\n",
       " \"A dry wine, companion to the winery's off-dry estate bottling. This does not give up its fruit as some dry Rieslings do; there is a pleasing mix of lemon, grapefruit, pineapple and apricot, full in the mid-palate, then turning more astringent and cheerily tart in the finish. This is very young, compact, and still tight as a drum; it could be cellared for up to a decade.\",\n",
       " \"Shows the way this vineyard and appellation ripen Syrah so well. Just overpowers the palate with cassis, licorice, leather and dark unsweetened, slightly bitter baker's chocolate, with a potent dose of freshly crushed pepper. So impressive, the perfect expression of great terroir in a great, cool vintage. But it's very tannic. Drink now through 2013.\",\n",
       " 'Here at last are the flavors that have been missing from Ste. Michelle Cabs for some time. This is crisply structured, varietally spot-on Cabernet. The ripe—but not jammy—fruit flavors of blackberry and black plum are amplified with spicy cinnamon from aging in American oak. There is a hint of chalkiness in the way the acids hit the palate, but otherwise this is picture-perfect, with well-delineated tannins and some delicious Asian spices on the finish.',\n",
       " \"Whether it's the vintage, or simply the evolution of winemaking at this new winery, this reserve Chardonnay is more restrained and structured than past efforts. Still young and compact, it shows succulent green apple and white peach flavors along with toast and butterscotch.\",\n",
       " 'For some tasters, this will seem a bit earthy; for others there is a note of animal. The fruit is thin, the finish chalky and astringent.',\n",
       " 'Very sweet, with powerful apricot, tangerine, pineapple and creme brulee flavors and good acidity to balance out the sugar. Vanilla ice cream would be a good match.',\n",
       " 'The oak stands out, giving this Pinot a vanilla, caramel and buttered cinnamon toast dominance over the underlying cherry jam fruit. Although the texture is nice and silky, the wine itself feels simple, especially at this price.',\n",
       " \"Merlot is tough to make anywhere, and Paso Robles isn't its best home. It's too hot there. This is a rustic, high alcohol wine, with an edgy texture and sweet-and-sour cherry flavors.\",\n",
       " 'Sweet and soft, with apricot, peach and butterscotch flavors.',\n",
       " 'Lots of juicy cherry, black raspberry, vanilla and smoky flavors in this soft wine, but it struggles to rise above simplicity. Would benefit from blending with harder, darker, more tannic varieties, like Syrah or Petite Sirah.',\n",
       " 'Plenty of tough mountain tannins in this classically-huge Howell Mountain Cabernet. Combined with dryness and acidity, it makes for one tough drink. Deep down is a solid core of blackberries, complexed with spices and earthy-mineral notes. This is surely one to age. Hold until 2018, and could go well beyond that.',\n",
       " 'Dry and sophisticated, this has flavors of Life Saver, black raspberry, cola and Tabasco that are a little slender. It shows an elegant structure, with plenty of mouthwatering Central Coast acidity Drink now.',\n",
       " 'Mainly Petite Sirah, this wine has a hot, baked taste, like cherry pie filling that burbled out of the crust and got burnt and caramelized in the oven. Drink now.',\n",
       " 'Combines rich, vibrant acidity with fruity intensity in a very clean, opulent wine. Offers waves of tropical fruits, honeysuckle, buttered toast and minerals, with a long, spicy finish. The extensive new oak is perfectly in keeping with the size of this crowd-pleaser. Now–2014.',\n",
       " 'Along with the Carmenère from Reininger, this stylish example belongs in the cellar of anyone with a hunger for this unusual variety. The green olive/herbal nature of the grape is carefully managed, and provides a nuance rather than a dominant flavor. At the core is tart red berry fruit and a wash of dark chocolate.',\n",
       " \"This Merlot over-delivers for the everyday price. It's bone dry and classically structured, with rich, ripe tannins and mouthwatering acidity framing flavors of cherries, red and black currants, dusty spices and cedar. Sommeliers, scoop this one up. More than 15,000 cases produced.\",\n",
       " \"A dull Rhône-style blend, this is soft and hot with alcohol. You'll find some green vegetable and mushroom notes that mar the ripe flavors of red cherry jam.\",\n",
       " 'From Calaveras County, this wine shows the ripeness and rusticity of the region. Insistent in blackberries, black currants and chocolate-covered cherries, it shows earthier layers of thyme and pepper, with edgy, slightly green tannins and a bitter finish. Drink now.',\n",
       " \"This is dark, chewy and rough, with an unyielding mix of herb, olive, earth, stem, green tea and brown sugared blackberry compote. It's showing some brick around the edges, which is softening up the tannins a bit, but not likely to age a whole lot longer, so drink up.\",\n",
       " 'This half Cabernet, one quarter each Merlot and Cab Franc offers a lovely mix of herb and earth, moderate density, nicely spiced, with brambly red fruits. It shows delicate old vine character, making up with refined herbal flavors what it lacks in fruit sweetness.',\n",
       " 'This is a really good Pinot Noir that will gain traction in the cellar. The cool vintage conditions show in the acidity and lean framework, but the California sun triumphs with flavors of ripe sour cherries with suggestions of mushrooms and minerals. Dry and complex, it should be better after 2016.',\n",
       " \"High-toned blueberry, blackberry and cherry fruit is accented with nuances of herbs and chocolate. This is still tannic, young, grapey and tight; the winery is always one of the first to release their red wines. The Pepper Bridge vineyard is in Walla Walla, though the bottle's label says Washington State. This wine clearly needs more time in bottle to reveal its deeper mysteries\",\n",
       " 'Made in a dry, acidic style, this fashionable young Pinot Noir needs some time in the bottle. It shows flavors of sour red cherry candy, thyme, pepper, smoke and cedar. Best between 2010–2012.',\n",
       " 'The fruit is hard and shows some earthy flavors of seed and stem, but this serviceable red has been enhanced with spicy, toasty oak flavors.',\n",
       " \"Not a bad wine, but too soft-heavy and sweet for my tastes, with cherry flavors that are on the medicinal side due to the very high alcohol. Almost 90% charry new oak doesn't really help.\",\n",
       " 'A young, freshly fruity wine, with a gassy berry-cherry liveliness and silky texture similar to Beaujolais. The finish on this Tempranillo and Cabernet Sauvignon blend is dry and spicy.',\n",
       " \"The source of dependably rich Chards, Rosella's has given Bernardus the opportunity to craft a wonderfully complex wine. It's ripe in flavors ranging from lime tart and kiwi to papaya, nectarine and Anjou pear. Delicious, although it would benefit from higher acidity.\",\n",
       " \"Is this Pinot so delicious now you should drink it right away? Or is it deceptively ageable? Both. It's luscious, with ripe raspberry, cola, spice, mushroom and sandalwood flavors that will be gorgeous with steak. But the tannins and acid are so structured, the wine will gracefully age through the next dozen years, increasing in complexity.\",\n",
       " \"Rich and ripe on the nose with dark black fruit and olives, this is an easygoing blend of Syrah, Cab and Merlot. Medium-bodied in style, it's soft on the palate with plush tannins and flavors of cooked plum compote accented by darker hints of olive and sage.\",\n",
       " 'A little sweet, which makes the wine less subtle, this Pinot Noir and Chardonnay blend has jammy raspberry, cherry and vanilla smoke flavors. The finish is very sweet.',\n",
       " \"A curious wine. It's not tasting at all good now. So tannic, so new oaky, it feels clumsy and astringent and awkward in the mouth. Then you realize how rich the heart of fruit is, offering an enormous array of blackberries, blueberries and black currants. The grapes are from Rutherford. The gamble is if the fruit will outlast the tannins.\",\n",
       " \"Very rich, ripe and dry, a Merlot with a drop of Cabernet that needs a year or two to resolve. It's fat and fleshy in cherries, violets, red currants and cola, with a dusting of cocoa, pepper and cinnamon. The tannins are ample, but very finely ground. Hold until 2011.\",\n",
       " 'Peppery and bright in acidity, this blend of half Grenache and lesser percentages of Mourvèdre, Syrah and Counoise is a bit mixed. On the one hand it offers red raspberry and pomegranate and perfumed aromatics; on the other hand, the earthiness detracts.',\n",
       " 'This treads the line between slightly rustic and refined. The tannins are sandpapery, and it has lots of zingy acidity, making the wine feel a little rough. But the core of blackberry fruit is rich and dynamic. Probably not an ager, so give it a good decanting, and drink it over the next 2–3 years.',\n",
       " \"This is only the sixth vintage that the Vineyard Select has been produced. Spicy and tightly built, this dense effort is made from Cabernet Sauvignon that was sourced from three Walla Walla vineyards. Notes of fig, cassis, chocolate, coffee and fresh earth are enlivened by a hint of citrus rind. All in all, it's a complex, well-appointed showcase of fabulous flavors.\",\n",
       " \"Nice and lush. The flavors of cherry, cassis, anise, milk chocolate and cinnamon spice are just delicious, and there's a good texture, too. Ripe, firm tannins girdle the wine, and just-enough acidity keeps it from tasting candied. Drink now for its youthful babyfat.\",\n",
       " 'A beautiful Chardonnay that shows ripe, long hangtime fruit flavors of pineapples, apricots, peaches and papayas, offset with clean acidity. Shows a touch of oak. Will satisfy Chard fans, and is super food-friendly with grilled salmon, shrimp, scallops.',\n",
       " 'Dry and spicy, with some green peppercorn and vegetal aromas and flavors that interfere with enjoyment. A few modest blackberry notes rescue it.',\n",
       " 'Rather tough and astringent now, with crunchy, dry tannins and acidity dominating. These are very fine vineyards but the vintage was so-so. With its core of cherries, red currants and cola, it could develop over the next six years.',\n",
       " \"This is hard to appreciate now because the fruit is so primary and upfront—like a heaping spoon of black raspberry jam—and also because the tannins are thick and tough. There's something almost rustic about it. On the other hand, six years or more in the cellar could reward. Made from Cabernet Sauvignon and Cabernet Franc, with a splash of Petit Verdot.\",\n",
       " \"This estate vineyard wine's complex nose melds mineral, spice and lime aromas with herb and floral notes. It handles the disparate elements gracefully, showing body but not weight, and has a soft, almost tender mouthfeel. There's a touch of floral sweetness in the mouth—as on the nose—offset by earthy, mineral flavors on a lithe frame. This wine shows real subtlety, but leaves us wishing for more depth. Finishes light, dry and flinty.\",\n",

       " \"Marlstone is an old, historic, proprietary wine, but it's been under-performing for some years now. A Cabernet-based blend of all five Bordeaux varieties, this wine is good but has a rustic edge to the very ripe berry and cherry flavors. It should be better.\",\n",
       " 'Great price for a Chardonnay this rich and attactive.Although the alcohol is relatively high, the wine feels balanced, with a proper tension between ripe fruit, oak, alcohol, lees and acidity. Offers savory flavors of lemondrop candy, pineapple tart and buttered toast.',\n",

       " 'Fat fruit, juicy and ripe, brimming with wonderful fruit flavors. The wine is unctuous, sinfully lush, and still balanced with berries and spice and some good toasty oak. Young and hard, but good stuff with a nice life ahead.',\n",
       " \"There's a wildland, coastal mountain taste to this wine, which brims with bone-dry, exotic, woodsy tastes of wild forest cherries, fennel, balsam, cola, volcanic minerals, raw beef and Asian spices, not to mention the sweet veneer of sandalwood. It's utterly distinct from other Pinots in its almost feral complexity, a wine that changes with every sniff and sip. Should develop through 2014. This is a great price for a Pinot Noir of this integrity and interest. Only 152 cases were produced, but it's worth the search.\",\n",
       " 'An unusual blend of Riesling, Huxelrebe, Viognier and Sauvignon Blanc, this has residual sugar of almost 3%, but marries the sweetness to a Vouvray-like tartness.

       " 'Big, raw and frankly not really showing its best now, this young Zin needs time in the bottle. It has everything that it takes for two or three years aging, at least. Aromas and flavors of crushed pepper, fennel seed and cardamom spice up the blackberry, roasted coffee and bitter chocolate flavors, while the tannins are hefty, but negotiable.',\n",
       " 'A mild, softly fruity wine, with unusual grace notes of sandalwood and incense. The fruit suggests cinnamon-sprinkled pears, and the acidity has been cut and softened. A little bit of a plastic, Band-Aid flavor infuses the finish.',\n",

       " \"A very big, jammy Pinot Noir. Purists will object that it's too extracted, but it's awfully good and nicely silky in the mouth. Tastes like a liquid fruit bar, with cherry, raspberry, milk chocolate, roasted almond, honey-granola and caramel flavors.\",\n",
       " 'This is sharp, acidic and tannic, with hints of blackberry fruit, but too much VA and no depth.',\n",
       " \"Very full-bodied and rich, a densely structured wine that's too young to appreciate now. The cherries, raspberries, currants, roasted coconut, mocha frappuccino, date nut bread, candied ginger, orange tea and sandalwood are exotic and almost overpowering, but the wine never loses its tense control. Now through 2012, at least.\",\n",
       " 'A little sharp in the mouth, with a bite of citrusy acidity, but the cherry, cola, pomegranate and sandalwood flavors are very rich, and the texture is silky. The acidity could resolve in a few years. Best by 2012 or so.',\n",
       " \"Thick and dense, with managed tannins and a nest of oak, this marquee wine offers classic insight into the Napa Valley. It's weighty and somewhat smoky, with a lurking sense of minerality and balance. A powerful grip gives way on the lengthy finish to satisfying end notes of coffee and toffee.\",\n",
       " \"This is a bit bigger than the “regular” 2003 Two Vineyards red wine, but doesn't have the same level of complexity and finesse. Ripe, tannic, hearty and a bit chalky, this 95% Cab Sauvignon gets the “reserve” tag due to its size rather than its subtlety.\",\n",
       " 'A nice improvement over the 2005 version of Estate Midnight Red, this is 60% Cabernet, with the other four Bordeaux grapes making up the rest in equal (10%) proportion. Dark and sappy, with lush flavors of cherry sour candy, mocha, chocolate, licorice and baking spices, this combines the barrel and the fruit bowl flavors of Walla Walla Bordeaux blends to good effect.',\n",
       " \"Seems made in a less ripe style, a minty, wintergreen wine with hints of barely ripened blackberries and some briary wild berries. Drinks bone dry and fairly tannic. If you're into an earthier, more French Bordeaux style, try this one. Will benefit from a decade of aging.\",\n",
       " 'Even and smooth, this Paso Robles contender comes on strong with round, jammy red berry and rhubarb fruit offset by pepper and dusty rose accents. A green note does show early and persists, but the wine still has very good feel, and the silky finish displays a long pepper and red berry fade.',\n",
       " 'This vineyard-designated Sauvignon Blanc is full and round, with lots of oak over the mild grapefruit flavors, and very creamy texture. It tastes like a California version of a white Bordeaux, and finishes with spicy oak notes',\n",
       " \"Aged for more than two years in new oak, this 100% Cab bursts with smoky vanilla and char that currently dominate its underlying fruit. But it's likely that time in the bottle will meld everything together. The powerful black currant, black cherry, carob and tobacco flavors, wrapped into rich, soft tannins, suggest holding at least through 2008, and the wine should develop well for a decade.\",\n",
       " \"It's uncertain how old this “old vine” fruit actually may be. Barrel-fermented in neutral oak puncheons, this is a rather soft, neutral white wine, that could pass for a Trebbiano or something similar. There's a hint of almond along with some alcoholic burn in the finish, which nonetheless retains a crisp aftertaste, but otherwise there is not much flavor.\",\n",
       " 'An awkward wine. Smells a little vegetal, and tastes weirdly sweet in raspberry and cherry syrup, with a cloying finish. Ready now.',\n",
       " 'A bit soft and melted, but offers exotically rich flavors of golden mango, pineapple and cinnamon spice, in a custardy texture.',\n",
       " 'This Rhône-style blend contains a few drops of Petite Sirah. The wine is quite good, being dry and full-bodied and complex enough to linger over as it warms and changes in the glass. Shows interesting currant, pepper and cedar flavors, with a robust finish.',\n",
       " 'An elegant Pinot with a silky texture framing delicious flavors of ripe raspberries and cherries, elaborated with sweet spices and smoky sandalwood. A lovely wine to drink now.',\n",
       " 'Somewhat raisiny and bitter. Tastes like press wine, with harsh, grapeskin tannins that make it feel astringently dry. Pretty good flavors, though, of blackberries and currants. Drink up.',\n",
       " \"Aromas of lime, honey and petroleum mesh well with a hint of fresh brioche in this off-dry style Riesling. The flavor profile is a bit bony, featuring lemon, underripe nectarine and bitter green almonds, but there's a pleasant silkiness to the texture of this wine.\",\n",
       " \"You'll find strong flavors of grilled blackberries and black cherries, tobacco, unsweetened baker's chocolate and black pepper in this dry, tannic wine. Made from Syrah, Mourvèdre and Counoise, it's rustic and high in alcohol. Makes you think of beef tacos.\",\n",
       " \"An absolutely first-rate wine. It's dry, silky and savory, showing the crisp acidity and strawberry, mineral and cinnamon spice flavors of a fine Carneros Pinot Noir. Perfect now with crab cakes, roasted salmon, grilled chicken with rosemary new potatoes.\",\n",
       " 'Stillwater Creek may prove to be one of the great Grenache sites in Washington, which is experiencing a state-wide renaissance with the grape. This is a stellar effort, bursting with juicy red fruit, bourbon barrel, candied cherries, and a finishing layer of sweet chocolate. Though it bursts onto the palate with a rainbow of fruit flavor, it persists and shows both depth and length as well. Lovely.',\n",
       " 'This soft, round and fruity wine is styled for immediate consumption. Light fruit flavors of apple and Asian pear are finished with a lick of lemony acid.',\n",
       " \"Cedary and tight, this young, sappy wine has exceptional concentration and weight. Big and a bit blocky, it lacks the feminine grace of the Ciel du Cheval bottling, but compensates with pure power and expression of terroir. Fruit flavors of dense berry and cherry are beautifully managed. Delicious now, it's a wine to age and enjoy for up to a decade.\",\n",
       " 'This soft, light-bodied wine is on the savory side, a taste of cranberry and rhubarb at its core. It dances in cooler-climate aspects of forest floor and herb, with an unexpected aroma of menthol sneaking into the mix.',\n",
       " \"Smells and tastes Porty, with caramelized raisin and black currant flavors. And with nearly 17% alcohol, it's hot.\",\n",
       " 'The vineyard is on benches between Rutherford and St. Helena. The wine is immaculate Cabernet in the modern style, soft and rich in blackberries and cherries that are so ripe, they veer into melted chocolate. This yumminess is complexed with smoky oak, and balanced with just enough dusty tannins to keep it all from collapsing.',\n",
       " \"Lots to like in this Lake County wine. It's very crisp in acidity and clean, with a minerally scour to the lemon, lime and kiwi flavors. On the minus side, it's rather sweet, which gives it a fruit juice quality.\",\n",
       " 'A sharp, herbal blend of Syrah and Cabernet Sauvignon, showing hints of resin in its aromas. The pale red fruit flavors are tart, light, and simple.',\n",
       " \"Mainly Syrah, with Cabernet Sauvignon. The wine was made with free run juice, which gives it very pure, strong fruit flavors and almost none of the earthiness you might want for balance in a complex red wine. It's also very new oaky. The result is massive cherry, raspberry, cola and bacon flavors that are jammy and sweet.\",\n",
       " 'This racy Cabernet is full of tart red fruits; its flavors are forward and lightly spicy. The wine seems to have been acidified, perhaps to provide some lift. It is a nicely focused effort; I like the way it gathers itself and holds that focus through a smooth, seamless, long finish.',\n",
       " \"This Cabernet-based Bordeaux blend is very fine, and shows the classic structure of Rutherford. The tannins are rich and dusty, and there's a sour candy taste to the red and black cherries, enriched with smoky oak. With a long, richly spicy finish, it should easily negotiate the next 6–8 years in the cellar.\",\n",
       " \"Tasted pre-release, this is clearly ready for prime time. It's both compact and generous, with a core of wild berries soaked in minerals. The words lucid and crystalline come to mind—rarely applied to a red wine, let alone Cab Franc.\",\n",
       " \"A step beyond the immense 2003, this actually supercedes the sheer massive power of that wine with a sleeker, more elegant structure. Classy, bright, lifted scents lead into a peppery, red-fruited Syrah annotated with citrus oil. Tart, young, clean and delineated, it is Matt Loso's immaculate, concise winemaking at its best. This can go a long way; it continues to add depth and layers of mineral and texture as it breathes open.\",\n",
       " \"With alcohol reaching 14.6%, this reserve bottling is quite ripe—some might say too ripe—with fruit tasting of raisins and prunes. There's plenty of oak, a hint of smoke, and heat in the finish.\",\n",
       " 'A pale pink color, it brings notes of strawberry and watermelon, drinking dry with tart cherry flavors and a slightly clipped finish.',\n",
       " \"This is the most complete of the four Prince Hill clonal selection bottlings. It has flavors of cherry, Dr. Pepper, cherry candy and a hint of incense. It's a pleasant, easy-drinking wine best consumed while still young.\",\n",
       " 'This biodynamically farmed vineyard delivers stunning, elegant, textured Pinot. Layer upon layer upon layer develops in the mouth, from the ripe strawberry/cherry fruit, masterfully speckled with toast, espresso and cola notes. The mouthfeel is silky and supple, and this lovely wine lives up to its name with an innate resonance that lingers gracefully in the mouth.',\n",
       " \"Everything about this wine is good except for the thinness. It's dry and tart, with crisp acids framing lemon and lime, fig and melon flavors, and a fine, clean finish. You find yourself liking it so much, you wish it had a little more depth and length.\",\n",
       " 'A bit simple, but fruity and pleasant, with pineapple, vanilla, honeysuckle, peach, apricot and spice flavors. Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc and Gewürztraminer.',\n",
       " \"There's a rich, velvety texture here, and it's fully dry, but the fruit has a baked quality, and the burnt char of oak adds to that smoky astringency. Finishes salty. Might simply be going through a clumsy stage.\",\n",
       " 'Heavy, sweet and soft, with syrupy flavors of milk chocolate, blackberries, anise and pepper. Will appeal to those who like this rustic, easy style.',\n",
       " 'Shows real class and elegance for a Cab of this price. Ready to drink now, its richly tannic structure provides the framework for dry, complex flavors of blackberries, cherries, red currants, anise and herbs. Give it a few hours of decanting.',\n",
       " 'A very fine effort, with classic cassis and black cherry in the fruit core, but also offering interesting details of bark, earth and herb. The wine lingers, perhaps due to excellent natural acidity, and without overpowering the palate it keeps tantalizing it with nuances of moist earth and wet rock.',\n",
       " 'Appealing aromas of tobacco, smoke and spice herald the masculine edge to this red blend. Flavors of chocolate, smoke, spicebox and pepper are carried by a bright, red fruit wave. A touch tart on the finish but overall well rounded.',\n",
       " \"Ripe fruit combines with fine tannins to make for a Cabernet that's easy to drink, yet good enough for an expensive cut of steak. The black cherry and raspberry flavors have a brambly edge, almost like a Dry Creek Valley Zinfandel. Don't look for Napa smoothness and opulence; instead, let the rustic nature of this wine charm you.\",\n",
       " 'Richard and Thekla Sanford of Alma Rosa produce much lighter styles of Pinot Noir than many of their neighbors. In this bottling, that translates to bright pomegranate and cranberry fruit with hints of anise and rose on the nose. The palate offers raspberry fruit and sagebrush spice, with a strong, grippy texture.',\n",
       " \"Lots of acidity in this very dry, somewhat austere young Pinot Noir. That sharp bite is relieved by fruity flavors of raspberries, cherries and cola, not to mention sweet oak. Give it a good decant, but it's always going to be tart.\",\n",
       " 'Electric pink in color, the aromas are light, with notes of cherry, strawberry and herb. It drinks dry with tart elegant fruit flavors that linger.',\n",
       " 'This begins as a hard, tight wine with hints of rose petal around a core of blackberry hard candy. The balance is superb, and the wine is lively with nuanced, dark notes blending smoke, espresso and bitter chocolate. An intriguing animal scent surfaces after some hours of breathing.',\n",
       " \"Perhaps because the winery's co-owner, Frank Ostini, is a restaurateur, he makes his wines in a forward, approachable style that doesn't require aging, although they're balanced enough for the cellar. The '06 Rio Vista is a fresh, silky wine whose smoky cherry and pepperspice flavors will soar with a grilled steak. Should hold nicely for six years.\",\n",
       " \"A delicate, silky mouthfeel makes this wine feel light and vibrant, yet there's nothing light about the flavors. Notes of wild cherries, cranberries, Dr. Pepper, anise, pine and savory spices explode on the palate, and they lead to a long, dry finish. Give it 5–6 years in the cellar.\",\n",
       " \"Like all of Carr's '08 Pinots, this one's marked by tart acidity. It gives a sour cherry candy taste and prickly mouthfeel. But it's quite rich, and as the wine breathes in the glass, its attractions mount. Give it two or three years in the cellar.\",\n",
       " 'The flavors are herbal, the tannins a little green, but no rough edges have been left. Could be a good burger bottle.',\n",
       " \"Disappointing, especially from this winery and vineyard, at this price. It's high in acidity and tough in tannins, and oak just adds a caramelized sweetness to the jammy raspberry and cherry flavors. This Syrah isn't going anywhere, so drink up.\",\n",
       " 'This 50/50 blend of old vine fruit from these two excellent vineyards is a bit overpowered by the massive amount of new oak flavor. The fruit may be a little more delicate than the barrels. Still a fine wine, loaded with cassis and blackberry fruit among the more substantial flavors of earth and tannin. The herbal character of the grape is preserved, adding black olive and coffee to a finish that shows some heat.',\n",
       " \"This is 100% Zinfandel, unlike the regular bottling, from specially selected barrels. 300 cases made. There's concentrated raspberry fruit in the nose, good intensity on the palate, with a good, rich mouthfeel and full, soft tannins in the finish.\",\n",
       " 'A very nice and drinkable Sauvignon Blanc with some extra dimensions of elegance. It has a rich, creamy texture that frames exotic flavors of tropical fruits, kiwis and limes. The acidity is brisk and mouth-cleansing, a perfect counterpoint to the richness.',\n",
       " \"Despite 15.1% alcohol, this is dull, one dimensional and rather light. The tannins are a little beefed up, but there's marginal fruit and everything seems a bit out of whack.\",\n",
       " 'A pretty good Pinot Noir, dry and elegantly constructed, with crisp acidity and a backbone of tannins. The flavors of raspberry and cherry fruit are delicious, but the texture is scoury and a little warm, even though the alcohol is relatively low.',\n",
       " \"Like the winery's other 2005 Chardonnays, this one, tasted in March, is tightly wound and minerally. The aroma will show little if the wine is too cold. Flavor-wise, hints of tart tangerines, lemongrass, green apples, candied ginger and vanilla cream swirl into a smoky oak, spicy finish. This is a Chardonnay that needs some time in the bottle. Drink now and for a couple of years.\",\n",
       " \"A great value, easy drinking Syrah from the Sierra Foothills's Zin masters, Renwood, who have produced here a mouthful of blackberry and plum juiciness that is full and sweet. Pair with roasted beef or lamb for a succulent meal.\",\n",
       " \"Too raw and acidic for me, with jammy blackberry and cherry flavors, this Pinot unsuccessfully tries to make up in power what it lacks in finesse. It's a good wine, but a disappointment given the lineage, which stems directly from Caymus.\",\n",
       " \"Dashe uses 30-year-old vines from Guinness McFadden's farm in the southeastern end of Mendocino County, organically grown and planted in rocky, chalky soil. Golden in color and thick in texture, the wine has lovely acidity and is definitely dry, austere and very Germanic, with a nutty earthiness.\",\n",
       " \"Old-vine Kestrel Vineyard fruit delivers; this is excellent juice. Concentrated and lush, it's packed with pineapple, green apple, hints of pear and light tropical fruits. A fruit-driven, powerful wine, with cracker and oatmeal flavors showing up in the finish.\",\n",
       " 'An intense blue-purple wine, young, grapey and striking. The classic Klipsun core of iron/mineral is there, along with tight, spicy fruit, and plenty of acid for long-term aging. The complex layers of flavor are a good way from being fully integrated, but the track record of the winery and the vineyard suggest that they will come together beautifully over time.',\n",
       " \"Irresistible is the word that comes to mind to describe this Pinot, which is available only in magnums. The vintage was California's finest ever, and the wine shows spectacularly ripe red currant, cherry, tangerine zest, licorice and beef jerky flavors, with just the right touch of smoky oak. Yet the structural balance of acidity and fine tannins gives it the perfect architecture. Best now in its flashy youth and for the next 4 or 5 years.\",\n",
       " 'This has that distinctive diesel-fuel aroma often associated with Riesling; while that aroma is atypical of Grenache Blanc, this remains a successful wine. Bone dry, bright in acidity and mineral-driven, it shows a citrus flavor, in addition to that petrol note.',\n",
       " \"As with the Ciel bottling, this is pure Syrah from a single vineyard. As usual, the Boushey is more forward and opulent and this vintage is packed with flavors and scents of smoked meat, herb, red fruits and chocolate. Despite its heft it remains precise, focused and beautifully defined. No blast of new oak; it's got wonderful balance.\",\n",
       " 'Smells ripe and oaky, with tons of blackcurrant and blackberry fruit. Almost sweet in the mouth with rich oak and ripe fruit, but quite dry, with firm tannins that turn almond-skin bitter on the finish.',\n",
       " 'A tart pineapple-lemon nose with caramel and smoke accents ushers in a full palate. Apple and pear flavors add body, and a chalky note contributes complexity and texture to the palate. Slight creaminess provides a fat, full feel, but maybe just a bit more softness than some tasters preferred. Still, this is a solid wine with finesse and body. It displays both smoky toast and bright orange-lemon notes on the finish.',\n",
       " 'Alluringly seductive aromas of black cherry syrup, blueberry pie, blackberry preserves and fresh-cracked black pepper draw the nose into this blend of Lone Oak and Valley View vineyards, located 800 to 1,000 feet in elevation. Flavors of blackberry-chocolate liqueur, plums and black cherries are elevated by pine sap, rosemary and strong tannins that maintain perfect grip. Serve with lamb.',\n",
       " \"Another lovely Gewurz from Navarro. Made with neutral oak fermentation, it's rich and crisp and spicy, with a mélange of exotic fruit and wildflower flavors.\",\n",
       " 'This full-bodied Chardonnay begins with aromas of vanilla toast, herbs and cream, followed by toasty spice and fruit flavors. The finish is lingering and curvy. Not terribly complex, but a good cohort to lobster, crab and creamy pasta dishes.',\n",

       " 'This Chardonnay straddles the line between complexity and simplicity, with toasty orange and pineapple flavors brightened with citrusy acidity. Savory minerality adds interest and food friendliness.',\n",
       " 'Full of vitality from start to finish, this wine has bright flavors of pear and melon. Well balanced and refreshing, pair it with Asian fare and spicy seafood, or enjoy it on its own.',\n",
       " \"This is a big, ripe Zin from a great vineyard in a warm part of the appellation. There's a lot of heat, but it works well with the blackberry pie, cherry tart and milk chocolate flavors. Nice and dry, if a bit soft.\",\n",
       " 'Scents softly suggest rose petals and milk chocolate, leading into a wine that seems to hit a hard stop midpalate. A clear flavor of cold steel resonates against a counterpoint of tart berry fruit.',\n",
       " \"You'll find a rich vein of cherries, red currants and cedar, leading to a dry, spicy finish, but the velvety smoothness you want in a fine Merlot is what it lacks.\",\n",
       " \"A sturdy, drily tannic red wine of considerable complexity. There's wild berry and spice flavors and a brambly mouthfeel. The alcohol is a high 15.3%, but balanced.\",\n",
       " 'A feminine, almost soft Pinot Noir, this opens nicely with scents of roses, red fruits, and pine forest. Despite its light color, it has plenty of grip and density in the mouth, even bringing some streaks of light milk chocolate into the finish.',\n",
       " 'Beautiful Zin, lush and decadent and heady. Hits you with the most wonderfully ripe chocolate, blackberry and cherry marmalade, licorice and spice flavors that are so rich, they would be gooey without the balancing acids and tannins. Drink this wine with the richest possible fare, like short ribs of beef.',\n",
       " \"This top-of-the-line Cab surely must be one of the last 2001s to be released. It's an exquisite wine. New oak dominates, with caramelized vanilla and char. But it's appropriate given the size of the fruit. The black currant, Hoison sauce, crème de cassis, milk chocolate and licorice flavors are completely satisfying. Best now and for the next ten years.\",\n",
       " \"This is a very rich, ripe, flamboyant Pinot, made in the lush California style. It's flashy in complex tiers of raspberries, cherries, red currants, licorice, cocoa and cinnamon spice, yet is silky and dry. The fruit comes from Sonoma Coast, Green Valley and the Middle Reach. An impressive followup to the inaugural '07, and a bottling to watch.\",\n",
       " \"The texture stands out on this dry, balanced wine. It's all velvet and silk in the mouth, almost like Pinot Noir, but everything else screams Zinfandel. The flavors are wild and exuberant, of innumerable wild berries, pepper, licorice and sweet, smoky bacon. Should develop over the next four years.\",\n",
       " 'Smells fresh and invigorating, but in the mouth it has raisiny flavors. This is a young Pinot, rich in acids and tannins, but that overripe quality limits ageability and makes the wine a bit one-dimensional. Drink now.',\n",

Finishes dry, brisk and slightly tart.',\n",
       " 'This is ripe and pungent, a rich and fruit-driven mix of fig, peach and melon. There are interesting herbal highlights, and more acidity than in the past.

Right now, the grapey, slightly plummy fruit and dried herbs are not entirely integrated.\",\n",

The blend is of the two Cabs, Sauvignon and Franc. The quality of the tannins is perfect, and so is the effortless way the wine has absorbed 100% new French oak without the wood sticking out. My only criticism, and it's a big one, is excessive ripeness that makes it Port-like. The alcohol is 15.5%.\",\n",

Great middle, good length.',\n",

       " 'The immediate impression is of extreme youth and mandatory cellaring. Bluntly, this is not an easy wine to like now. It has a peppery edge, and the blackberry fruit is buried under tons of dark, brooding tannins. Best to age until at least 2009, but it should be worth the wait.',\n",
       " \"Tight and spicy, this offers a mix of red fruits, strong streaks of clove and licorice. There's an underlying taste of stem, and the acids leave a chalky aftertaste.\",\n",
       " 'Native yeast, weekly batinage (lees stirring) in 50% new barrels, and, most importantly, a superb vineyard—Stillwater Creek—make for the best Chardonnay yet from Sparkman. Yeasty and young, dense and loaded with fresh pear, toasted nuts and butter, this is seductive and immensely enjoyable.',\n",
       " \"A great success for this bottling. With extraordinarily high residual sugar, the wine is very sweet in wild honey, infused with the essence of oranges and apricots, folded into rich, buttery custard, and sprinkled with vanilla sugar and cinnamon. It's all balanced with a squirt of lime acid. If that sounds good, it is. Only 95 cases were produced, but finding this wine is worth a search.\",\n",
       " \"Dry and very tart in the mouth, with a mouthfeel that remains acidically severe despite rich flavors of cherries, black raspberries and Dr. Pepper cola. There's a nobility of tannins, and Pinot's essential character shows through, but that acidity is pretty strong. Now–2012.\",\n",
       " \"Here's a well-made wine that shows that this important producer can rise to the challenge when it retains its focus on varietal character. This authoritative, smoky wine smells like Syrah and it follows through with firm, supple, rich flavors. The floral and citrus notes, the herbal/olive underpinnings, the ripe—not roasted—fruit all hit the mark.\",\n",
       " \"A difficult Pinot Noir to evaluate. It's very dry, acidic and tannic, with sharp flavors of blackberries that sweeten into jam on the finish. The question is one of ageability. Try cellaring for five years and see what happens.\",\n",
       " 'Sharp and candied, with Lifesaver sweet-and-sour cherries and cola softened with smoky wood notes. The tannins are sandpapery and firm. Drink now with rich beef and lamb.',\n",
       " 'This full-bodied, focused and distinctive wine has a deep, dark color, aromas of black cherry and cocoa, and flavors that are ripe and lingering. It offers power and complexity.',\n",
       " 'Though just 12% alcohol, this wine is ripe and vibrant, with a thrilling bouquet of violets, cranberries and fresh herbs. Light and delicate, perfectly balanced and complex, with a whiff of chocolate in the finish.',\n",
       " \"Sourced from one of the older vineyards in the region, Mettler has stayed true to Lodi's larger Zinfandel style with Epicenter, a wine that's black as night with notes of dark berry, plum, tar and brick, as well as a hint of tobacco and dark chocolate. Layered and complex, it's full bodied, but retains enough acidity to taste balanced despite its oak and ample alcohol. Enjoy with hearty fare.\",\n",
       " \"Lightly spritzy, sharp and focused, this Pinot Gris brings in apples and pears, fruit skin and wet stone. It's nicely balanced and ready for food.\",\n",
       " 'A fine Pinot, with the lush, silky texture you expect from this variety. The flavors are rich, of sour cherries, red plums, red currants, herb tea, orange zest, cinnamon and pepper. The finish is very dry and firm in tannins. Should develop well over the next six years.',\n",
       " 'This Bordeaux blend offers satiny, silky smooth and chocolaty flavors. The fruit shows plum, black cherry, blackberry and hints of prune, with an underpinning of herb. The finish leads into black tea, sweet and ripe tannins that have just enough spine to extend the flavors into a full minute.',\n",
       " \"A pretty good Pinot Noir from a producer that specializes in it. Shows the classy balance of the winery's more expensive bottlings, although it's not as rich in fruit. But it's still a nice, dry wine. Easy to find, with 35,800 cases produced.\",\n",
       " 'A finely crafted wine, but one that has some unripe elements. Sweet and supple in the mouth, this gets an A-plus for mouthfeel. But rhubarb and unripe red-fruit aromas and flavors mar the healthy chocolate, spice, vanilla, tobacco and blueberry. Finishes with plenty of oak flavor.',\n",
       " \"The Youngs produce a stunning Cabernet from their vineyard on the eastern benchlands of the valley. This Cab is the polar opposite of Napa, and defines the alternative possibilities. Soft, intricate and herbal-earthy, it has beautiful black cherry, cocoa, tobacco and new oak flavors, and it's thoroughly dry. Drink now through 2015.\",\n",
       " 'From down in Paso comes this soft, chocolaty Merlot. Acidity is deficient, but this kind of flavor goes a long way to saving the wine, which has the taste of perfectly ripe, crushed blackberries.',\n",
       " 'Pretty much like a good Dry Creek Zinfandel, maybe even spicier. This red wine is medium-bodied, dry and very fruity, with flavors of wild cherries, blackberries, blueberries and chocolate. Great with a charbroiled steak or burgers.',\n",
       " 'Smells like graphite and rich, dark fruit—very promising. Soft, plush and plummy on the palate, just comes up a bit short on the finish.',\n",
       " 'Soft, round and textured, this is a minty Zinfandel with a pronounced jolt of smoke on the long finish.',\n",
       " 'The Rock Star Red is a 50/50 Cabernet/Syrah blend. The two grapes work well together in many wines, but here they seem a bit at odds. The Cabernet carries some green, herbal, pickle barrel flavors; the Syrah brings in pepper and spice, but neither has the ripeness to flesh out the wine sufficiently. There are flavors of plum and cooked cherry, then it hits some chewy tannins and stops short.',\n",
       " \"This is quite unusual, loaded with notes of green herb, leaf, fiddlehead fern, pepper and lemon verbena. It's herbal and not at all disagreeable, though fruit-lovers may want to look elsewhere. Just 50 cases of this wine were made.\",\n",
       " \"A limited-production (183 cases) wine from the estate vineyard. It's a supple, smooth, solid effort, not as substantial as their other Syrah, yet far pricier. You'll find typical Syrah fruit, perhaps a bit too much chalky tannin, and a nicely resolved finish. Overall it's clean, sharp and true to the varietal.\",\n",
       " 'Thick and foresty, this Pinot Noir embodies the extremes of the Perli Vineyard. It bursts with dark blue and earthy red fruits that are tempered by a savory undertone. This wine takes time to reveal itself, so age it for 5–7 years, and pair it with stews, risottos or seasoned braised lamb.',\n",
       " \"Here's a rich, lively wine marked by grassy, citrus flavors veering into ripe figs, and shaped by barrel fermentation and oak notes. It has a nice, creamy, leesy texture, and is dry and spicy.\",\n",
       " \"Amazingly rich flavors mark this Cab, ranging from blackberries and black currants to earthier notes of herbs, cola and olive tapenade. It's dry, and the tannins are lush and easy. Super easy to drink, but could benefit from greater structure, as it's a bit too soft.\",\n",
       " \"This is the palest and lightest of Calera's ‘02 Pinots, but paradoxically it's enormously concentrated in flavor and possible the most ageworthy. It explodes with cherry cola, cherry pie filling, raspberry, blueberry, cocoa-dusted latte and cinnamon-nutmeg spice. But it has the depth and balance for the long haul. Best now through 2012.\",\n",
       " 'From both Muscat Canelli (65%) and Muscat Giallo (35%), this fragrant and inviting wine is exactly what it proclaims to be, slightly sweet in honeysuckle, citrus and crisp texture. It offers lightness and lingering acidity in a moderate-alcohol package.',\n",
       " \"A very fruity Zinfandel, rewarding in blackberry, blueberry tart and currant flavors, accented with dark chocolate, anise and pepper. Too soft, and would benefit from greater crispness, but it's a nice Zin now.\",\n",
       " 'Williams Selyem expresses the intricacies of this vineyard with more consistency than any other winery. This remarkably intellectual, ageworthy wine is bone dry, with marked acidity and complexity. The flavors range from wild cherries, cola and balsam to raspberry tart and buttered cinnamon toast. Its complexity is like a mandala, increasing in beauty the longer one examines it. A softly tannic bitterness lingers on the finish; drink 2019–2030.',\n",
       " \"From Three Thieves, who are establishing a reputation for value, comes this Cab, a blend of four coastal counties from Paso Robles to Dry Creek. It's ripe, soft and easy, with blackberry, chocolate, mint and vanilla flavors.\",\n",
       " 'A mélange of sweet and spicy berries—like delicious pastry—is front and center here. This pure varietal, single vineyard Syrah was fermented in large, neutral barrels, pushing the fruit forward. Hints of loam and white pepper add interest, though the wine flattens out a bit in the finish.',\n",
       " \"Made in the modern style, this Chardonnay is very ripe and rich in jammy pineapples, green apples and limes, enhanced with smoky, caramelized oak and a creamy, slightly sour note of lees. It's fortunately balanced with crisp acidity. Best now and through 2012 before the fruit goes south.\",\n",
       " 'Very dry and tannicly tart, with blackberry, currant and pepper flavors touched with oak. This is a good, everyday wine to drink with rich meat dishes and cheeses.',\n",
       " \"Starts out sulfury, a smell that's very slow to blow off. Beneath that eggy scent, this Petite Sirah, Barbera, Zin and Carignane blend isn't bad. Dry and tannic, it shows a robust earthiness reminiscent of certain Spanish reds. But the sulfur kills it.\",\n",
       " 'Tastes honey sweet in butterscotch, buttered toast and caramel. The sweetness dominates well ripened pineapple and tangerine flavors. But the fruity power is there. It needs a year or so in the bottle to emerge, and even a brief decant will bring greater harmony to this expressively opulent wine.',\n",
       " \"Powerful vanilla scents rise from the glass, but the fruit, even in this difficult vintage, comes out immediately. It's tart and sharp, with a strong herbal component, and the wine snaps into focus quickly with fruit, acid, tannin, herb and vanilla in equal proportion. Firm and tight, still quite young, this wine needs decanting and/or further bottle age to show its best.\",\n",
       " \"The sweet grapey aromas on the nose don't mislead, but rather lead to concord-grape and pears-in-syrup flavors. A touch of spritz on the palate adds a little life, and it's at its best well chilled.\",\n",
       " 'Assertively grassy, this pungent Sauvignon Blanc also carries a fairly strong diesel scent. Call it Pouilly-Fumé in style, though as a New World wine, it has more fruit, without the bracing minerality. The finish is clean and medium in length.',\n",
       " 'A light, elegant nose of almonds, apple and honeysuckle, followed by fresh flavors of nuts, apple and flowers on the palate. Pretty, balanced and lingering in the finish. A great food wine.',\n",
       " 'Despite reductive scents of rubber tire at first sniff, the aromas quickly open up and the wine shows round, raspberry and cherry fruit, ripe and clean. There is just a hint of light chocolate in the finish (50% new oak was used), with a tart underpinning but persistent fruit flavor throughout.',\n",
       " 'From organic grapes, this fresh, slightly sweet Chenin Blanc marries lemongrass, pear and citrus skin flavors with a hint of butterscotch. Very nice through the midpalate, then a quick fade.',\n",
       " \"Elegant structure on this wine, with a graceful silkiness, although it's a bit lacking in concentration, especially at this price. Shows jammy cherry, raspberry and spice flavors, with a coating of smoky oak.\",\n",
       " 'An enormously opulent wine, brimming with gobs of red cherries, currants, mocha, clove, cinnamon and pepper flavors. Impresses for the lushness and integrity of the structure. Brilliant wine, just gorgeous, a real crowd-pleaser. With its recent track record, Kynsi enters the front ranks of California Pinot Noir producers.',\n",
       " \"Some will criticize this Chardonnay for being too oaky and sweet, but it sure is delicious. It just brims with pineapple, yellow apricot, crème brûlée, honey and buttered toast flavors that are balanced with crisp acidity. If you like that California style, you'll love this opulent wine.\",\n",
       " 'This is 100% Merlot, ripe and soft, with a buttery, luscious mouthfeel. The fruit is pretty and round, offering up tangy plum, cherry and cooked berry. Tannins are in the background; there is an impression of residual sugar, though the specs say none is there. Nonetheless, the wine is soft, accessible, fruity and quite pleasant to drink.',\n",
       " \"This year Byington blended in some Syrah with the Cabernet Sauvignon, to good effect. I wish the wine were crisper and better structured, but there's no denying the deliciousness factor. The black currant pudding, cherry pie and vanilla-sprinkled mocha flavors are irresistible.\",\n",
       " 'A serious personality comes from oaky, earthy aromas and flavors, a bit of welcome astringency and good acidity. It seems full bodied, dry and rich enough in texture to be appealing without losing the tanginess underneath.',\n",
       " 'This Chardonnay is so delicious in citrus, tropical fruit, peach and vanilla bean flavors, brightened with brisk acidity, that you hardly miss the absence of oak.',\n",
       " \"Albariño works in California when it's completely dry and minerally, because the variety's high acidity and citrus flavors make for a crisp, mouthwatering wine. The trouble with this one is that it's not dry. It has sugary citrus flavors, and that makes it acceptable but disappointing from this fine producer.\",\n",
       " \"A smooth, rich, creamy Zin, luscious in blackberry jam, chocolate and spice flavors. It's on the soft side, which accentuates the alcohol, but it sure is delicious. Drink now with BBQ.\",\n",
       " 'A nice, lush Chardonnay. It lacks a bit of exciting structure, and depends too much on sheer dazzle. But it sure is rich in toasty oak-inspired pineapples, peaches, pears and limes. Good now with grilled shrimp.',\n",
       " 'Features a complex mix of oak and fruit, with aromas and flavors ranging from cedar, cinnamon and cocoa to mocha, black cherries and dried herbs. Fine tannins and crisp acidity complete the package. Drink now or age up to five years.',\n",
       " \"True to Amador's brawnier style, this Zin is still tightly tannic but shows ripe black cherry and blackberry flavor with plenty of dark chocolate and cocoa powder. Made from old-vine, sustainably grown grapes, it's priced fairly and should open with age. Pair with a thick piece of meat.\",\n",
       " 'Sweeter than in the past, this blend of Cabernet, Merlot, Sangiovese and Cab Franc has overtly sugary flavors of blackberry and cherry pie filling that are not appropriate in a table wine.',\n",
       " \"This is a very dry, elegant bubbly that drinks “French” because the dominant notes are earthy, minerally and toasty, rather than fruity. At seven years of age, it's lost whatever fruit it had and is turning dusty and rich, a wine of structural austerity. Yet it's very fine.\",\n",
       " \"Lush tannins, ripe cassis, plum and espresso flavors, and nicely dry. The problem is a prickly heat throughout. Even for someone who isn't particularly bothered by high alcohol, it's hard to get past.\",\n",
       " \"This is a young, grapy wine, with primary scents of grapes accented with cola and tomato leaf. You taste grapes, berries, ginger and herb, with an interesting creamy streak of milk chocolate. It's a well-made wine with surprising complexity and length.\",\n",
       " 'Jammy and simple, a country-style wine with flavors of berries, cherries, cola and pepper. Pretty tannic, too. Drink now.',\n",
       " \"Shows a drier, leaner side of Pinot Noir, with leather, cola and cherry flavors as well as crisp acidity. Clean and uncomplicated, it's a decent wine for drinking now with a salmon salad sandwich.\",\n",
       " \"This is a young wine that needs cellaring to come around. Right now, it's tough in tannins, and the fruit is direct and primary. It really needs the alchemy of time for the wood, acids, tannins and flavors to come around. Give it three or four years for the black currants to marry with the cedar and become smoky-sweet.\",\n",
       " \"This is a tough, tannic and difficult wine to enjoy or evaluate now. It's full-bodied and dry, with good blackberry and currant flavors, and is well constructed. But it's very astringent; cellar it and see what happens. Try after 2013.\",\n",
       " \"An ambitious wine that doesn't live up to its reserve status. Most of the parts are here, from the ripe tannins and fine acidity to the moderate alcohol and toasty oak, but the currant flavors finish too thin for ageability, or to justify the price.\",\n",
       " \"Dry and tart in acidity, this Rhône-style white blend is pretty good for everyday purposes, but has insufficient richness. There's a vegetal streak that drags down the apricot and peach fruit flavors.\",\n",
       " \"Made from 100% Sauvignon Blanc, with a great many vines more than 50 years old, this is an enormously complex wine. Fruit doesn't dominate. Flowers and minerals do, with flavors of stones, herbs and earth. What fruit there is brings to mind tart limes and lemons, perhaps white apricots and peaches, with peppery Asian spice accents. Has the weight of a great red wine, and is bone dry. Don't drink it too cold. Will age for a long time, perhaps a decade, in a cool cellar.\",\n",
       " 'Underlying the tart fruit flavors of crisp apple and cucumber are spicy, peppery highlights. At the moment, the new oak barrel flavors often found are not evident, but wines go through interesting morphs along the aging curve. This one is just starting to soften up. Organically grown and limited to just 107 cases.',\n",
       " 'A blend of four vineyards, this is an extremely impressive Merlot. It dazzles with rich, ripe black currant, cherry liqueur, raspberry, milk chocolate, smoky oak and spice flavors that are complex and go on and on through the finish. Beyond that is the texture, so refined and elegant, combining power and subtle elegance. Just a gorgeous, sensual Merlot. Drink now–2010.',\n",
       " 'A sharp herbal note permeates the crisp red fruit aromas. The wine is surprisingly smooth, and the tannins have a sanded, silky quality. The flavors are a pleasing mix of strawberry, cherry, milk chocolate and caramel.',\n",
       " 'Harsh, with rough tannins and sweet and sour cherry flavors.',\n",
       " 'Very consistent in style with previous vintages, this textural, lemony, racy Riesling seems bone dry, though it is noted as having 1% residual sugar. Along with rich flavors of grapefruit and citrus, there are nectarine and pear fruit highlights and a sharp minerality.',\n",
       " \"Talbott's style is always exotic and eccentric, with the grapes tasting so ripe, they have an almost botrytised, apricotty flavor. So it is with this '06, which also brims with grilled pineapple and sweet smoky oak. Best now.\",\n",
       " 'Raw and hot, with a burnt cherry pie taste and a dry, tannic finish.',\n",
       " 'This classic big Zin, at 15.9% alcohol, is a softly tannic wine of complexity. The fruity flavors of blackberries, brambly forest-picked wild berries, cola, leather and licorice have a white pepper and tobacco finish.',\n",
       " \"Sweet, ripe and intense, with vibrant acidity brightening lime, kiwi, orange, pear and pineapple flavors. It's long-hangtime Edna Valley fruit, pure and simple.\",\n",

       " \"Merlot has long been Waterbrook's strong suit, and this offers the expected seamless blend of cherry/berry fruit, softly polished tannins and toasty barrel flavors. What are missing—at least for the moment—are the grace notes. Give it plenty of breathing time and you begin to detect traces of spice and earth, finishing with a lick of chocolate.\",\n",
       " \"This 100% Syrah is dry and rather aggressive in texture. The black pepper, acidity and tannins combine to make it hard, bitter. There's a solid core of melted blackberry jam, black currants and dark, unsweetened chocolate, leading to the possibility of ageability. Try cellaring through 2011, then try again.\",\n",
       " \"This is the ripest of Fogarty's numerous single-vineyard Chards, with appealing peach, apricot, papaya and citrus flavors. But it shows the same dryness, elegance, acidity and minerality. A complex, food-friendly wine that will interest sommeliers.\",\n",
       " 'New Dijon clone plantings at this well-established vineyard have cut down the leafy herbaceousness of past vintages. This is delicate, clean, lightly ripe, with hints of fresh tomato and pomegranate. It is the sort of Oregon Pinot that truly emulates cru villages Burgundy; light, appealing, and ready to drink.',\n",
       " 'Warm vanilla notes are laid across ripe nectarine, apple skin and a twist of lemon rind on this single-vineyard study by the Los Gatos-based winery. Pencil lead kicks off the palate, which then opens into poached apples and lemon oil, laid across a sizzling acidity that lasts long.',\n",
       " \"A blend of Cab Sauvignon and Franc, Merlot and Syrah from the makers of Firesteed wines. This clean, accessible Columbia Valley red wine includes mixed red and blue fruits, soft tannins and a medium to light palate weight. It's smooth and fruit-driven, with consistent follow-through flavors that are well integrated. The finish carries the slightest suggestion of oak.\",\n",
       " \"Good price for a firm, steely Chardonnay that's elegant and dry through the finish. Minerals and citrus fruits mark it, with a Meyer lemon tartness given added richness from 25% new oak fermentation. Ready now.\",\n",
       " 'A blend of Sauvignon Blanc, with one-quarter Sémillon, this white blend was aged on the lees in oak barrels. It shows the balanced elegance this bottling by Brander usually displays. Entirely dry, with a crisp burst of acidity, its flavors are of citrus fruits, white flowers, vanilla, minerals and a touch of tart, New Zealand-style gooseberry. Great with roast pork or, if you can get it, wild boar.',\n",
       " \"Granted, there haven't been that many, but this is the best California Albariño I've had. A wonderful wine, crisply acidic and deeply flavored. Candied citrus zest, peach pie, pink grapefruit, buttery honeysuckle, apricot, nectarine, and no oak because it doesn't need any. A spectacular food wine or just cocktail. Shows the promise of this variety in the right climate.\",\n",
       " 'An enormous wine, rich and complex and tannic enough to cellar. Made from the estate vineyard in the Sebastopol area, it floods the mouth with savory cherry, cola, rhubarb, cocoa and cinnamon spice flavors, wrapped into a silky, velvety texture.

The wine sports a stylish, mildly spicy finish. Top Value.\",\n",
       " \"This 95% Cabernet Sauvignon perfectly captures the vineyard's strengths: lush, ripe, fleshy fruit that shows perfectly ripened flavors of cherry and cassis, bolstered by ripe, chewy tannins. It's substantial but not tiring; the balance of fruit, acid and tannins holds it together through a spicy, lingering finish. It's just a delicious wine, and one that should cellar well also.\",\n",
       " \"Shows real Stags Leap character in the dusty tannins, dryness and power, yet appeals with lush cherries, currants, spices and cedar. It's balanced and harmonious now, and should develop over the next six years.\",\n",

       " \"Brilliant. That crisp, tart Edna Valley acidity provides the perfect counterpoint to the orange, peach, apricot, honeysuckle flower and mineral flavors. This unoaked Riesling is a joy to drink. The winemaker suggests Mexican dishes, but it's super-versatile.\",\n",
       " \"Zins hardly get much bigger or bolder than this one. With very high alcohol, it's dry and full bodied, with a glyceriney mouthfeel to the blackberries, cola, mocha and peppery spices. Drink now.\",\n",
       " \"So young, it tastes like it's still fermenting. Not a bad wine, but freshly tart and strong in grapy flavors. Should calm down by mid-2011 and become a nice, full-bodied and dry red wine.\",\n",
       " 'From Chilean winemaker Aurelio Montes comes this Cab of considerable depth and power. It shows well-developed blackberry and cassis flavors. The tannins are significant. Give it until 2011 to begin to open, and it should drink well through 2014. Cellar Selection.',\n",
       " \"Deliriously delicious, decadent, stupendously flavorful, words can't describe the impression this massive wine makes. It's an explosion of blackberry pie, cherry marmalade, vanilla fudge and Oriental spice flavors, all carefully controlled in a dry, crisp, softly tannic package. All Loring's wines possess superripeness, but this one somehow brings balance and sophistication. Wow.\",\n",
       " \"Made in the Mazzocco style of extremely high alcohol and Porty-sweet flavors of blackberries, raisins, chocolate and pepper. If you like this kind of high-octane Zin, it's for you.\",\n",
       " \"Sweet in peaches, pineapples, oranges, honeysuckle and vanilla, but balanced with crisp acidity. It's an opulent Rhône blend of Viognier, Roussanne, Marsanne and Grenache Blanc.\",\n",
       " \"A bit briary and rough in tannin texture, but with very rich blackberries, blueberries and chocolate, with a touch of smoky, charred oak. Drink this nice Cabernet now while it's fresh.\",\n",
       " \"Lovely aromas are a perfect mix of dust, rock, cassis and black fruits; the flavors carry so much detail that it's hard to catalog it all. Subtle but well defined, they cascade over and around each other in a gentle profusion—there is black cherry, then rock, then lead pencil, then some smoke, then a whiff of licorice, and so on. A fascinating wine with good aging potential.\",\n",
       " 'This is made in the somewhat austere style of a Loire valley Chinon, done well here, adding nothing harsh, bitter or unpleasant to the wine. You will also find soft plum and cherry fruit, modest but perfectly ripe and proportionate, rounding out the midpalate.',\n",
       " \"Rigidity and acidity mark this young Pinot Noir. It's tart and a little tannic, but it has enormously rich flavors of cherries, currants, cola and pomegranates, enriched with smoky, spicy oak. Fine now with decanting and pairing with very rich fare, but should reward a few years in the cellar.\",\n",
       " 'A worthy followup to the 2008, showing crisp acidity and rich flavors of citrus fruits, New Zealand-style gooseberries, and vanilla spice, with a honey sweet finish. Drink now with Vietnamese food or sushi.',\n",
       " \"With delicious texture and concentration, this Lake County blend of Grenache, Syrah and Mourvedre from the 3,000-foot-high Fore Family Vineyard is intensely good, a deep reddish-purple blueberry-tinged infusion of earth and clove spice with dry, tight tannins and even a little lavender that'll linger. This one'll age, but is so convincingly reminiscent of the Northern Rhône right now, it'll be hard to wait.\",\n",
       " 'Call it Chablis-like. This Chard is bone dry, crisp in citrusy acidity, and features stony, minerally flavors of Meyer lemons and limes. Try as a richer alternative to Pinot Grigio.',\n",
       " \"Fans of Petite Sirah will exult. This darkly brooding wine is heavy, tannic and fully dry, although at the cost of very high alcohol. The flavors, of extraordinarily ripe red and black cherries, currants, espresso, sweet leather and mushu plum sauce, finish with an unsweetened dark chocolate bitterness. It's a wine that will evolve over a decade.\",\n",
       " \"Nice and crisp in acidity, with a brisk, clean mouthfeel, this houses citrus and tropical fruit flavors. It seems a little sweet, so don't expect anything too dry.\",\n",
       " 'Nine vineyards spread throughout eastern Washington contribute to this tart, earthy and dark-toned Cabernet. The alcohol reaches almost 14%, and in this vintage the acids are quite pronounced. Firm, focused cassis and black cherry fruit is framed in polished tannins. Grill a steak and slice some cheese and you are ready to roll with this one.',\n",
       " 'Cherries are the name of the game here, from beginning to end. Red cherries, black cherries, cherry jam, cherry pie, cherry liqueur. The texture is smooth, and the finish is dry. This is a nice, fairly complex wine that will elevate a great cheeseburger.',\n",
       " \"A beautiful young Rutherford Cabernet, showing the dusty elegance and complexity of a top estate. There's a rich herbality to the cherry, cassis and blackberry fruit, suggesting fresh green chervil, sage and thyme. Oak adds harmonious notes of vanilla, cedar and char. The tannins are thick and juvenile, but very finely ground. With 8% Cabernet Franc, this lush wine needs time. Hold until after 2008, and it should improve for another six years, conservatively.\",\n",
       " 'Tight, acidic and a little green, this lacks the generosity and opulence you expect of a Pinot Noir from this famous vineyard. The cherry fruit is laced with mint and tobacco leaf notes. Drink now.',\n",
       " 'This is a delicious Merlot that seems to showcase the warm Calistoga climate in its soft tannins and power-packed black cherry, blueberry and licorice flavors. The edge of oak is sweet and smoky. Drink this intricately layered wine now.',\n",
       " \"Doesn't taste quite ripe, with very dry, herbal flavors and also a strong hit of acidity. Almost suggests wintergreen sour candy, although there's some decent cherry and cola, accented, of course, by oak. Awkward, but could just be young. Hard to tell.\",\n",
       " 'Extraordinarily rich and ripe, if a little high in alcohol. Shows great extract, with masses of squashed, gooey cherries, raspberries and oodles of spices. Feels opulent and dramatic, with smoky oak adding to the complex, almost feral layers. So much going on in the glass. Just gorgeous now, and should hold and develop over the next 4–5 years.',\n",
       " 'Grapefruit, pear and vanilla mark this medium-bodied, moderately dense and youthful wine that also offers peeks of caramel and toffee midpalate. The weight and length give way to a zesty, pithy finish.',\n",
       " \"I found the winery's regular '04 disappointing. This commemorative bottling is oakier and much riper in tropical fruit flavors, with non-malolactic crisp acidity and a buttercream texture. Somehow, though, it lacks the power and follow-through a great Chard should have, especially at this price.\",\n",
       " \"A lively nose of minerality and spice is followed by a more opulent wine on the palate, with flavors of honey and flowers and a slightly viscous mouthfeel. Though curvy, it's not overly sweet, and finishes clean.\",\n",
       " \"Although it's less pricey than the winery's Encell Pinot, I slightly prefer this one for its accessibility. It's a tart, silky wine, with coffee, cherry and spice flavors, and a real drink-me quality, but it is acidic. Drink it with rich fare, such as duck, salmon and even pork dishes.\",\n",
       " \"Too acidic for comfort, with a harsh bite that's almost vinegary. Too bad, because the underlying cherry and cola flavors are just fine.\",\n",
       " \"Off-dry and spicy, with underlying peach and grapefruit flavors. There's plenty of acid; maybe just a bit too much unless that's your style. Only a somewhat thin, chalky finish keeps the score from ratcheting up a notch or two.\",\n",

       " \"The blend in this Pauillac-inspired cuvée is based on Cabernet Sauvignon, resulting in a wine that's slightly more structured than the others. Tobacco and cassis pick up hints of toffee and brown sugar on the finish. Drink now–2015.\",\n",
       " 'Rustic and dry, this has flavors of berries, currants, licorice and spices. Made from Cabernet Franc and Cabernet Sauvignon.',\n",
       " 'Good, but feels tartly acidic and unintegrated now, with buttery new oak sticking out, and plenty of jammy sour cherry and red currant fruit. Shows all the signs of an ager, but the window of opportunity is narrow. Roll the dice and try 2010–2012.',\n",
       " 'Aromatic and floral, this lovely bottle has a tangy, nicely defined core of raspberry, cranberry and pomegranate. The tannins are crisp, the acids bracing, the fruit etched in minerals, and the balance poised and appropriate to the lightness of the wine.',\n",
       " 'Soft and syrupy, with semisweet flavors of berries and anise.',\n",
       " \"There's been no price increase for this outstanding value, but the quality keeps going up and up. It's packed with juicy red berry and cassis fruit—supple, tangy, deep and lingering.

       " 'Cedar- and menthol-scented oak complementweedy cassis fruit,  Full bodied, shows a touch more greenness in the finish.',\n",
       " 'Very ripe and oaky, but a little on the obvious side, with flamboyant tropical fruit, honey and buttered toast flavors. Could use greater finesse, subtlety, complexity.',\n",
       " \"Velvety aromas of blackberry-spearmint chiffon greet the nose on this wondrous bottling from the Mainini Vineyard. The wine's mouthfeel is sexy, luxurious, soft and supple, with unctuous yet not overbearing flavors of dark chocolate, plum, black pepper, truffle and shaved licorice.\",\n",
       " 'Shows pleasurable cherry, raspberry, blackberry, coffee, cola and dusty spice flavors that are complex in their own way. But the wine is overly soft in both tannins and acids, leaving all that fruit out there to fend for itself, without balancing structure.',\n",
       " 'Delicious in pastry-filling raspberry and cherry flavors, with a baked brown sugar richness and exotic touches of vanilla, cinnamon, anise and toast. Dazzles with a direct hit to the palate; is soft and dry. But it has a certain surface one dimensionality. Seems at its best now–2013.',\n",
       " 'A bit divisive among our panelists, with one finding it rather light and lacking in intensity, while others found virtue in its understated yet varietally correct nature. Cola and cherry flavors finish clean and fresh.',\n",
       " \"Shows fine, mouthwatering acidity and a steely clean finish, with pleasant citrus and floral flavors. But it's kind of sweet. If you like that, it's a nice wine at a fair price.\",\n",
       " \"Soft and almost sweet in jammy, pie-filling raspberries and cherries. It's luxuriously soft and silky, with polished tannins, and lots of people will love it. Would benefit from greater depth and complexity, but it sure is lovely. Drink now.\",\n",
       " \"Off by a few beats from recent vintages, maybe because production was far higher, the '06 Westside is a good but ordinary Zinfandel. It's soft in acids and tannins, with jammy blackberry, raspberry, cherry and cola flavors that have a distinctly brambly edge.\",\n",
       " \"There's little if any oak on this Chardonnay, which allows brisk Central Coast acidity and bright, long hangtime fruit to star. And that fruit is rich, suggesting tangerines, nectarines, Meyer lemons and Asian pears. Very nice with crab risotto, or with a beautiful roasted chicken.\",\n",
       " \"This Syrah is marked by rich, extracted flavors. It's strong in blackberries, cherries and raspberries, coated with lots of smoky, caramelized oak. The deliciousness factor is very high. Drink now for decadent youthfulness.\",\n",
       " 'This is bone dry, light as a feather and as simple and basic as only Merlot can be. It hints at flavors of rhubarb and bark, with all its components balanced out, but offers no depth or nuance.',\n",
       " 'Very rich and opulent, if a little soft, offering a flood of orange cream pie, meringue, butterscotch and cinnamon spice flavors. Delicious, if a bit one-dimensional. Try as an alternative to an oaky Chardonnay.',\n",
       " 'This 2004 is a really nice rendition of this wine, silky and seductive, almost soft upon entry but rich and intense with beautifully mixed flavors of baked fruits, cinnamon, smoke, coffee grounds, black tea, vanilla custard and a lick of butterscotch. In short, this is an extremely entertaining wine that showers the palate with a three ring circus of sensuous flavors.',\n",
       " \"This is intriguing on the nose, with loads of fresh apple and floral perfume merged with darker tones of petrol and pine needles. Off-dry in style, it's lush and fruity, with ample melon and stone-fruit flavors. It finishes dry, with a splash of citrusy acidity.\",\n",
       " \"This is Rick Longoria's Bordeaux-style blend. It's not at all like a Napa Cabernet, which is the inevitable comparison, but instead shows a crisp, white wine-like acidity, and an underlying herbaceousness, the result of the region's cool climate. The flavors are fine, offering currants, cherries, mocha and oak, with a peppery finish.\",\n",
       " 'A sensual aroma of musky spice and strawberry starts this wine out well. On the palate, the wine offers an interesting mix of delicate, dancing flavors and rounder, bigger spice. Unique, with some heft.',\n",
       " \"As soon as this Chardonnay hits the mouth, it explodes with ripe, heady flavors of pineapples, mangoes and limes. There's a complexity to the palate that makes it hard to believe its unoaked.\",\n",
       " 'This Bordeaux blend is full-bodied and ripe in blackberry, cherry, currant and cola flavors, with smoky, oaky notes. Tasted in the winter of 2008, it had a dry, tannic astringency that suggested pairing with rich, marbled meats. Should develop in the bottle through 2012.',\n",
       " \"An upscale hamburger wine, fruity and spicy. There's a bacony, smoked meat note to the raspberries and cherries that will play well against the char of grilled beef.\",\n",
       " 'Would have benefited from being held back a year or so longer before release, but you can compensate by cellaring it. Dry, very full-bodied for a Pinot Noir and rich in tannins, it shows robust blackberry and black cherry flavors. Should mellow and improve after 2015 or so.',\n",
       " 'Great crunchy acidity and 10.5% residual sugar go a long way to making this unoaked white dessert wine pleasantly drinkable. The wine has orange, honeysuckle and vanilla flavors.',\n",
       " 'This well-structured effort is 100% Cabernet Sauvignon, and it bears nuances of herb and briar. There is a balanced mix of plum and black cherry flavors that are wreathed in smoke and coffee notes, which resolve into firm but smooth tannins.',\n",
       " 'From Chilean winemaker, Aurelio Montes, this 100% Cabernet shows massively concentrated flavors of ripe blackberries and cassis, with richer notes of dark chocolate, anise, spices and smoky cedar. What an amazing tannin structure, intricate, fine and complex. A wine to drink now for sheer opulence or to age for at least a dozen years.',\n",
       " \"A sophisticated, swanky Zinfandel, although it's gentle and delicious enough to appeal to anybody who likes a full-bodied red wine. Floods the mouth with blackberry, cherry, chocolate, bacon, pepper and charred barrel flavors that go on and on. Drink this beautiful Zin with steaks, chops, roasts and hard cheeses.\",\n",
       " 'This Rhone blend is harsh and dry. It has a green, twiggy edge, but also superripe flavors, as if the grapes were unevenly ripened.',\n",
       " \"Made in the modern California Chardonnay style you'll either love or hate. It's enormously extracted in pineapple tart, crème brûlée and honey-drizzled buttered toast flavors, and the acidity is bright and clean. The superrichness would benefit from greater control.\",\n",
       " \"The blend is 60-40 Grenache-Syrah, and the name comes from French slang for something that is luxurious, really chic. Sappy, grapy, nicely lifted and vivacious, this is a beautiful mix of fruits in a spectrum from watermelon to strawberry to red plum to raspberry and pie cherry. There's plenty of acid and just a whiff of pepper from the Syrah.\",\n",
       " 'Shows true cool-climate varietal character in the aromas and flavors of cherries, cola, pomegranates and rhubarb pie, with complicating notes from charred oak barrels. Very good, mouthfilling and dry, with brisk acidity. Should develop in the bottle for a few years.',\n",
       " \"This single-vineyard selection is aggressively tannic, earthy and herbal. Time may help smooth it out. There's plenty of black fruits and dark chocolate, and chewy, somewhat rough tannins.\",\n",
       " \"A very good wine, glamorous in the way of Oakville Cabernets, with beautiful tannins and flavors of blackberries and cassis. But it's also very oaky, with a caramel and wood char sweetness that's a little too dominant. Doesn't seem like an ager.\",\n",
       " 'Made from Syrah, Mourvedre and Grenache, this is a fairly ordinary red wine, with cherry, currant, smoke, spice and herb flavors. Drink now.',\n",
       " \"The percentage of Grenache has been bumped up in Rôtie's second vintage, now at 70%, with the rest an even split between Syrah and Mourvèdre. Soft and spicy scents are laced with a mix of rock and vanilla. This nicely structured yet approachable wine might be mistaken for a Washington take on Priorat. The underlying minerality gives the light, plummy fruit a solid footing, and extends the length considerably.\",\n",
       " \"A unique version of Andrew Will's Champoux, this is more than half Cabernet Franc, with Merlot, Cabernet Sauvignon and Petit Verdot filling in the rest. Thick and tannic, yet perfectly ripe and almost silky, it coats the palate with black cherry, graphite, slate and a bit of chalk. All that said, the fruit more than holds its own against the terroir's minerality. Drink this with your best steak, and give it plenty of breathing time.\",\n",
       " 'With 7% residual sugar, tastes sweet and common, with chocolaty blackberry flavors that finish sharp.',\n",
       " 'Impossibly sweet for a dry table wine, with sweetened cherry, blackberry and coffee flavors that taste like they have measurable residual sugar.',\n",
       " \"With 17% residual sugar, this supersweet wine seduces the palate with intense honey, but sweetness isn't enough. It falls short on the fruit side. If the apricot, peach and pineapple flavors were more intense, this would be a sensational wine.\",\n",
       " 'Tastes sweet and honeyed in pineapple and lemon Lifesaver candy, with a sharp cut of acidity that tastes almost unnatural. Feels overly manipulated, but will appeal to lots of people.',\n",
       " 'This complex, sophisticated and undeniably delicious wine blends strong flavor components into a harmonious whole. Aromas are lightly smoky and toasty, while flavors emphasize black tea, Bing cherry and sweet vermouth. The texture is firm and fine-grained giving a very smooth mouthfeel, and the finish lingers nicely.',\n",
       " \"The 10% Petit Verdot stiffens up the tannins and has a lovely violet-scented floral component that counterpoints the cassis and black cherry fruit. It's a young, tight and beautifully crafted wine that has barely come out of the barrel; it's still shut down and shy. But all the right stuff is there for a long-lived, elegant and silky wine with great breed and style.\",\n",
       " 'Like its companion Cabernet, the Lewis vineyard designate is still quite hard and unyielding when first opened. The dense, complex aromas suggest the power locked up within, and the wine slowly emerges, at first peppery and herbal, yet layered and complex; then showing some silk and satin, with a strong licorice streak.',\n",
       " 'The acidity is pretty fierce, but the wine is dry, and offers easy flavors of cherries, raspberries, red currants and sandalwood. The blend is Merlot and Cabernet Franc.',\n",
       " 'A classic Dry Creek Zinfandel, dry, medium-bodied and spicy, with wild berry fruit and that inimitable briary note to the mouthfeel. Really pleasant, with rich, ripe berry, licorice and cedar flavors. Ideal with barbecue.',\n",
       " \"Built like a Zinfandel, this hearty red wine is filled with wild berry, pepper and clove flavors, and is dry. It's a bit angular and harsh in tannins. Fine with barbecue and beef stew.\",\n",
       " 'This is an extraordinarily rich Chardonnay, built along Burgundian lines. A deep gold color, it explodes in tangerine-infused butterscotch, honeysuckle, citron, spice and tangy mineral flavors, and finishes with a savory bite of coastal acidity.',\n",
       " \"A disappointing vintage for the estate vineyard. It's earthy and bitter, showing far too much of the tomato-leaf herbaceousness that can plague Oregon Pinot. Leafy and chalky through the finish, it is a charmless, herbal wine.\",\n",
       " \"This is a full, round and juicy wine, with pronounced orange, tangerine and pineapple aromas and flavors. Wonderful hints of vanilla and spice accent the bright tangy core of citrus fruit. A wine that's big and packed with fine ripe fruit, but isn't over the top.\",\n",
       " \"With thick but polished tannins and interesting black currant, cedar and peppery spice flavors, this bone-dry Cab shows lots of Napa-esque pedigree. It's not meant for aging, so drink now.\",\n",
       " \"A welcome return to form after the disappointing 2005. Massive, dark, saturated and spicy; laden with black fruits, smoke and charcoal. The dark flavors run right into bitter chocolate and roasted earth, but don't mistake the descriptors to suggest this is anything but extremely delicious, with a long and very satisfying finish. 100% Merlot, all estate grown.\",\n",
       " 'Light and clean, this is a gentle take on Pinot Noir, comparable to a modest Bourgogne from a big shipper such as Bouchard. The alcohol rests comfortably at 13.5%, and the wine is done in a fruit-forward, drink-now style that fits the price point.',\n",
       " \"Just this side of dry, this is a round, soft, polished Zin, rich in cherry, cassis, coffee and milk chocolate flavors, with a pleasantly spicy, peppery finish. It's a lush wine with a small percent of Syrah.\",\n",

It's compellingly delicious, and isn't that what wine is all about? Flavorwise, it tastes of cherries, oranges, red currants, violets, raspberries, cedar and peppery spices, with 65% new oak. The tannins will help carry it across the finish line by 2012 or so.\",\n",
       " \"With no oak, this polished wine shows only pure varietal flavors of pineapples, lemons, limes, green apples and vanilla. It's pure and clean, with brilliant, mouthwatering acidity, and totally dry. One of the best unoaked white wines in California, it's easy to find, with 8,700 cases produced.\",\n",
       " 'Good and dry, with complex layers of blackberries, black cherries, tobacco, herbs and oak. The tannins are wonderfully firm and refined. Suffers a little from excessive acidity, which makes it uncomfortably sharp. Drink now.',\n",

       " 'A big, bold, exuberantly rich wine, classic Williams Selyem Chard. The underlying wine is all pineapples, peaches, pears and exotic tropical fruits, while oak adds elaborate layers of buttered toast, caramel, nougat and vanilla. Acidity is high, which will help the wine age through 2013.',\n",

The color is a bit murky, and the flavors, though pleasant enough, have a certain murkiness also, mixing earth, toast, hazelnut, some indistinct red fruits and a finishing lick of raspberry preserves. It's a good, all-purpose quaffing wine, but doesn't quite conjure up Bordeaux.\",\n",
       " 'The core of this no-oak wine is medium-ripe fruit in the apple/pineapple mode. But a bitter, harsh aftertaste throws it off course, and it never recovers.',\n",

       " \"While delicate on the nose with scents of orange blossoms and fresh apples, there's a density on the palate of this dry Riesling that adds structure and style. Brisk with lemon-line acidity, its clean finish ends with a zesty lemon pith note.\",\n",
       " 'Phil Lane is the estate vineyard, and it delivers what is perhaps the most reticent and lightly herbal of all the K Syrahs. Along with black cherry and currant come pronounced flavors of bark, earth and forest floor. It has varietal character and excellent structure, but it can seem a bit harsh unless decanted for several hours.',\n",
       " \"Nearly all Syrah, with a splash of Viognier, this wine comes from some of the best vineyards in the Santa Ynez and Los Alamos Valleys, including the Happy Canyon area. It's a dramatic glass of red wine, bone dry and fairly tannic, with vast, intricate flavors of blackberries, black currants, teriaki beef, cherries, red licorice, cola, dark chocolate and toast. The Viognier brings a brightening dash of citrus and acidity. An extraordinary wine that will drink well through 2014.\",\n",
       " \"This is one of the riper of Siduri's crop of '05 single-vineyard Pinots. It bursts with cherry jam, sweet cola, vanilla and coffee fudge flavors that make it delicious, but it's no mere fruit bomb. The complex of acids, tannins and oak give it dimensions worth pondering. Best now and for five years.\",\n",
       " \"Shows a nicely dry, silky texture, with a good bite of acidity, and pleasant flavors of cherries, sweet smoky oak, tobacco and peppery spices. There's a tug of tannin that cries out for rich meats. Seems at its best now, so drink up.\",\n",

The alcohol is a ridiculously high 16.2% by volume, but it's balanced the same way that high alcohol in Port is balanced. The flavors are enormously rich with raspberry and cherry jam, white chocolate and buttered toast. Heady and flashy in that distinctly California mode, and made for drinking now.\",\n",

       " 'The vineyard is in the heart of the Rutherford bench. The wine is rich in fruit and tannins, but a bit clumsy, with a chunky, tannic mouthfeel and jammy, direct blackberry and blueberry fruit flavors. Not ready for drinking now, but well-made, and should age well, as Cabs from this stretch tend to have a long life.',\n",
       " \"This Bordeaux blend has a terrific structure, with a molten core of ripe, sweetly complex blackberries and black currants, but it's also a very tannic wine. The tannins are of the hard kind, tough and astringent, with a drying finish. The wine needs a year or two to mellow.\",\n",
       " \"The third vintage of the Beringer senior winemaker's namesake bottling is robust, yet approachable. This wine is lavishly—to some, overly oaked, but it's one of the best of this style. Apple, cinnamon bun, and smoke aromas give way to caramel, vanilla and spice flavors. Add a rich, round mouthfeel, and you've got a very seductive package. This wine is more about vigorous style, flavor and texture than subtlety. Only die-hard anti-oaksters will be able to resist its appeal.\",\n",

It's quite a distinguished wine, classic in the modern Napa sense of softness and ripeness to the point of decadent drinkability.

       " '“Whole cluster” refers to the fermentation practice of using intact clusters of grapes, rather than grapes that have been destemmed and crushed. This often results in an earthier, more tannic, spicier wine. This is big, rich and ripe, vast in cherry flavor, yet a little heavy.',\n",
       " \"Like all of Beringer's 2001 gold letter single-vineyard Cabs, this one is a cellar laydown. It's hard in tannins now, a dry wine that leaves the palate rasping because it's so astringent.

Sanguine, it traffics in pretty pomegranate and cranberry, with a quenching taste of kirsch-like cherry. Lightly spiced, it delivers an end note of milk chocolate on the lengthy finish, a stellar, drinkable wine from start to finish.',\n",
       " \"The wine is 100% Cabernet, sourced from a vineyard in the Mayacamas. It's very tannic and dry at this point.

It's a massively structured, flamboyant wine, tremendous in tropical fruit, pear, peach and apple flavors that taste like they've been baked into a pie, along with the sweet, smoky crust. A tremendous wine that must be paired with equally sized food. Lobster and scallops come to mind, served in rich cream and butter sauces.\",\n",

Still tightly knit, this wine very slowly unwinds long after you've swallowed that first sip or two.\",\n",

Best after 2012, and will develop in a good cellar for many years afterward.\",\n",

       " \"Doesn't say so on the label, but this is a dessert wine. It's very sweet and clean in zesty acidity, with pleasant flavors of Mandarin oranges and butterscotch.\",\n",
       " \"Greenwood Ridge does a terrific job with Scherrer's Alexander Valley Zin grapes, capturing the intensity of these century vines while maintaining balance. The flavors are powerful, of wild summer red, blue and black berries, crushed pepper, Asian spices, crème de cassis, licorice and cola. Enjoy this potent wine now through 2014, before it loses its fruit.\",\n",
       " 'From a single block at Temperance Hill, this aromatic wine neatly captures the terroir without pushing too hard. There are herbal nuances. a hint of hazelnut, some earth and wet stone, all nicely blended into a wine that is robust but accessible. Good balance and well-managed tannins.',\n",
       " 'Very deep and dense in the mouth, showing tough tannins and an immature fruit character that sorely needs aging. This is one for the cellar. Needs a few more years to come around and allow the cherries, blackberries and currants to emerge and meld with the oak. Best 2011–2015.',\n",
       " \"A couple of things about this wine are immediately striking: First is the fruit, which is enormously juicy to the point of jamminess, accented by smoky oak. Second is the smooth, supple texture, mainly due to the wonderful tannins. It's a complex, wholesomely dry wine, delicious now but with the structure to last at least a decade.\",\n",
       " \"Tasted in September ‘07, this Cab was pretty high in tannins, giving it a tough astringency some folks won't like. But the wine is clean and complex, with blackberry, tobacco and sage flavors. It's the opposite of a cult Cabernet, which is to say it's more like a traditional dry Bordeaux than something out of Napa.\",\n",
       " 'This is a truly appealing wine that seduces with chocolate-covered cherry flavors and soft, inviting tannins. The balance and concentration are all in proportion, with no reliance on too much new oak (just 25% first use) for the flavor. Details of spice and fresh tarragon enliven the aftertaste.',\n",
       " \"Mazzocco's Zins are dependably superripe and high in alcohol. This '07 is a big, strong wine, offering flavors of blackberry and blueberry jam, spread onto buttered white toast and sprinkled with anisette. It's delicious and heady.\",\n",
       " \"The best things about this Merlot are its extreme dryness, tannin integrity and relative austerity. It's a pleasure to drink a Merlot that's not a fruit bomb. That doesn't mean you won't find complex flavors of blackberries and currants. You will. It means that this extraordinary Merlot is pushing the envelope on what California, and Napa Valley in particular, is able to achieve in making Merlot along classically structured lines.\",\n",
       " \"Made from 70% Sémillon and 30% Sauvignon Blanc, this softly appealing wine has rich flavors of mangoes and guavas, with a cashew nut butteriness. It's smooth in the mouth, and a little honey sweet in the finish. A nice cocktail sipper.\",\n",
       " 'This is a changed wine from previous vintages, now emphasizing the berry flavors of the fruit and not shying away from some chewy tannins. It seems more honest and direct, without the wash of vanilla and jam, and more food-friendly as well, with the stuffing to take on a flank or hanger steak.',\n",
       " \"Simple and slightly sweet, this Central Coast Syrah has blackberry, cherry, currant, mocha, Dr. Pepper and fig flavors. It's easy to drink, and finishes soft and spicy.\",\n",
       " 'A little soft and lacking in structure, but otherwise a beautiful Zinfandel, filled with alluring flavors, and entirely dry. Offers waves of ripe blackberry and cherry tart, licorice, cola, currant and Asian spices that finish long and fruity.',\n",
       " \"Tasted in May, this Grenache-based Rhône blend was still overwhelmingly vibrant and fresh in grapey, primary fruit raspberry, cherry and blackberry flavors. It's appealing, but really needs some time to settle down and mellow, so the fruit and oak can mesh together. By the summer of 2009, it should be a wonderful wine, retaining its balanced lushness through at least 2012.\",\n",
       " \"This is a strongly flavored young wine. There's nothing subtle about the blast of blackberries, cherries and currants, of the sweet, smoky oak. The tannins are pronounced, giving a dusty astringency in the mouth. Should develop for 2–4 years.\",\n",
       " 'I love the delicate complexity of this Pinot, which is a blend of five vineyards along this famous wine trail. If you want to understand RRV Pinot, and particularly from the stretch they call the Middle Reach, study this wine. Dry, crisp and silky, it shows beautifully ripened cherry, raspberry, cola, pomegranate and spicy-herbal flavors, perfectly integrated with smoky oak, and the brilliant acid-tannin balance of a great vintage.',\n",
       " 'Sharp, green acids and tannins mar what is otherwise a fine Bordeaux blend. The blackberry and cherry flavors, which are well-oaked, have a tough, minty edge that detracts. Drink now.',\n",
       " 'Biodynamically farmed, this young vineyard seems to improve with each new vintage. More and more you find an expression of soil details—delicate streaks of dried leaf, moist loam, a flavor of clay. The fruit is refined and perfectly ripe, without being fleshy. An elegant style, cellar-worthy but delicious already.',\n",
       " \"Good fruit in this tannic mountain wine. Shows classic Cabernet flavors of blackberries, black currants and cedar. But it's tough and hard, and also acidic. Doesn't have the balance for the long haul, so drink now–2012.\",\n",
       " 'Front-loaded with candied fruit, this Cabernet has sweet blackberry, cherry and cola flavors, wrapped into firm, smooth tannins. Drink it now.',\n",
       " 'Made in a very ripe, forward style, with cherry jam, chocolate pudding and smoky oak flavorings. This straightforward Pinot flatters with its juicy opulence.',\n",
       " \"There's a good wine in here, but it's buried under so much oak, it's hard to taste it. The flavors of caramel and butterscotch swamp the underlying pineapples. Oakophiles will love it.\",\n",
       " \"A good, somewhat common wine that displays lots of rich fruit, but also the fundamental weaknesses that Sangiovese displays in California. The wine is dry and medium-bodied, with cherry, black raspberry, coffee and leather flavors. But it's a bit sharp in acidity and rugged in the mouth.\",\n",
       " \"A bit closed now, locked down by stubborn tannins and a slight mustiness, but it's a very good wine that should begin to open in a few years. It's got rich black cherry, currant and herb flavors. Best after 2008.\",\n",
       " \"Here's a lush, fruity Cabernet, brimming with blackberry, black currant and flashy oak flavors. It straddles that line between a tannic young wine you can drink now after decanting, and one to age. Probably best opened by 2015.\",\n",
       " \"Dry and soft. It's a good Cabernet for everyday drinking, with pleasant berry flavors and a smooth mouthfeel.\",\n",
       " \"Young and oaky now, showing an uncomfortable alliance of sweet vanilla and caramel with intense, primary fruit blackberry and cherry flavors. Syrah's innate pepper and meatiness offer additional complexities. Ungainly now, but has everything it needs to glide through 2013 while gradually developing nuance.\",\n",
       " 'With ripe blackberry, beef jerky and cassis flavors, wrapped into strong tannins, this is good to drink now with foods that want a dry, full-bodied and fruity red wine. It should hold in the bottle for a couple of years.',\n",
       " \"One of the best unoaked Sauvignon Blancs on the market. Clean and briskly acidic, it shows complex lemongrass, Meyer lemon, orange, green melon, fig, mineral and spice flavors. Could finish a bit drier, but it's an outstanding wine for cocktails, Asian fare and seafood salads.\",\n",
       " \"This Mendocino region has some very old Syrah vines, and they have produced a dark, soft, lush Syrah, with an earthy component to the blackberry and mocha flavors. It's pretty tannic, but that softness makes it instantly drinkable, and it's not likely to improve with age.\",\n",
       " 'From the estate vineyard in Philo, a spicy, gentle Pinot Noir with lots of finesse and complexity. Silky and elegant, it has flavors of freshly crushed wild cherries, sprinkled with cinnamon and nutmeg and a dash of cola. Drink now.',\n",
       " \"Ripe in jammy cherries and black raspberries, this Pinot shows fine acidity. It's tasty, but doesn't show much complexity. Drink now.\",\n",
       " \"This pale peach-colored wine brings vibrant aromas of strawberry and cherry. It's lightly spritzy, drinking almost completely dry with weighty feeling fruit flavors.\",\n",
       " 'Not very pleasant now due to the sharpness and bitterness of the texture, as well as the wood tannins that come from aging in 100% new oak. The flavors are of primary fruit blackberries, cherries and black currants. This is a big wine now lacking in polish, but it should develop in the cellar and begin to acquire bottle bouquet after 2012, continuing to glide through 2018 or so.',\n",
       " \"Good blackberry, cherry, cola and pomegranate flavors in this rich, dry wine, but it's also tight in tannins and brisk in acidity. Too hard and unsupple for drinking now. Give it 4–5 years to change in the bottle.\",\n",
       " \"A very nice, casual Merlot that has layers of complex elegance beyond just the fruit. And what fruit it is, ripe and sweet in cherry pie, raspberry cream, cola and vanilla, with a splash of cassis. Fortunately, there's enough acidity and tannin for balance.\",\n",
       " 'Sanguine and velvety, this richly derived wine made from one clone of Pinot Noir is tannic in black cherry, cinnamon and tar, with a lean, mid-length finish.',\n",
       " 'A bit sharp in acids, but the wine nonetheless has attractive Cabernet flavor, ripe tannins, and finishes with a dried herb taste. Seems like it was picked early. Try decanting for an hour or so before serving.',\n",
       " \"This Bordeaux blend is strong in oak and primary fruit flavors. It bursts in the mouth with an explosion of blackberry and cherry jam, caramel and buttered cinnamon toast. Delicious now, but a little direct and obvious. Hard to say where it's going.\",\n",
       " 'Lots of ripe, fruity flavors of cherry pie filling, enriched with brown sugar and cinnamon, while oak adds pie crust complexities of vanilla and smoky toast. The structure is very nice, with refined tannins and just-in-time acidity. Drink now.',\n",
       " 'A Meritage-style blend based mainly on Cabernet and Merlot, grown in Mendocino, Sonoma and Napa counties. Slightly rustic in tannic structure, it has sleek flavors of berries, currants, charred oak and spices. A pretty good value for this sweetly charming wine.',\n",
       " \"Like pepper in your Syrahs? This one's for you. It's distinctly Californian, in the superripe blackberry, currant and chocolate flavors. The appealing softness suggests drinking now.\",\n",
       " \"This extraordinarily rich Syrah swamps the mouth with jammy blackberries, raspberries and cherries. There's nothing subtle about it. But it's basically dry and properly balanced with acids and tannins, which gives it needed balance. Drink now and through 2014 to experience the youthful opulence.\",\n",
       " 'Dry and tart in acidity, this Pinot Noir offers cherry-skin-like tannins that give the palate a brittle sensation. Give it 5–6 years to let the raspberry and cherry flavors meld with the notes of oak and mineral. It should last the next 15 years, gradually losing its fruit and gaining earthy, mushroomy complexities.',\n",
       " 'Notes of honey and baked apple waft curiously amid white floral aromas on this semisweet Riesling. The perfume can be a tad cloying, competing with sweet lychee and pink grapefruit flavors on the palate, but white tea on the finish adds elegance and restraint.',\n",
       " 'This is Riesling done in a forward and fruity style, showing a mix of peach, apple and pear flavors. Broad and accessible, it finishes with a sweet dusting of powdered sugar.',\n",
       " 'Aromas and flavors of sandalwood and grenadine layer around this velvety, seductive wine. It offers black tea, truffle and forest floor, the body sinewy and complex. Savory in cinnamon and clove on the finish, it needs more time to open; decant or cellar through 2021.',\n",
       " 'Crème brûlée creaminess combines with tart citrus fruitiness in this wine, which displays great balance and richness. A nice oak frame holds it all together and provides a handsome framework for the lime-orange-tangerine citrus core. The palate has buttery caramel and wintergreen accents. Long, serene finish.',\n",
       " 'Shows the Etude signature of extraordinary richness and great structure, along with the paradox of early appeal combined with ageability. Floods the mouth with raspberry, cherry, orange zest, Dr. Pepper cola, vanilla and sweet oak flavors that turn dry and refined in the finish. This bottling continues to be one of the best, most flamboyantly enjoyable Carneros Pinot Noirs.',\n",
       " \"Lime and other citrus fruits predominate in this lean and tangy wine that's a refreshing relief to the multitude of oversugared and overoaked wines in this category. There's a faint spritz on the palate and the citrus profile makes up for slightly low acidity. Finishes mild and even.\",\n",
       " \"This is a very low-production, best-of-barrels selection by the winemaker. It's an extremely tight young wine, austere and almost searing in acidity, with a yeasty taste from sur lies aging. If you're looking for opulent, immediately accessible Chardonnay, this isn't for you. But the wine has tantalizing hints of grilled pineapples and nectarines, and the powerful structure suggests cellaring. Stash this away for a couple of years.\",\n",
       " 'Black Box hops onto the popular sweet red wine train with this blend. It is, as advertised, sweet, but not too much, giving a sugary edge to the blackberries and cherries.',\n",
       " 'Shows the dryness, crisp acidity, flowers and minerality that often mark Carneros Chadonnays, which makes it elegant and sleek. With a touch of Meyer lemons and limes, it rises to richness.',\n",
       " 'Though the aromas show a stemmy, green character, pea vine and earth, rather than fruit, there is just enough raspberry and tart cassis fruit to hold things together. Could accommodate a burger or a pizza.',\n",
       " 'A little soft and one-dimensional, with raspberry and cherry cola flavors. Lacks the liveliness that a rosé needs. No oak on this dry wine.',\n",
       " \"A bit heavy handed, with lots of tannins and acidity, and the jammy cherry-berry fruit is in your face. It's made in a big, bold style that will appeal to fruit-forward fans.\",\n",
       " 'This vineyard is a magical site, one of the greatest Oregon Pinot vineyards. The wine has the majestic plumpness of grand cru Burgundy, with potent cherry fruit, laced with sweet spices, that seems to expand through a generous midpalate and keep on keeping on as long as you are paying attention.',\n",
       " \"A challenging name for a pretty good wine, given the frost and smoke issues so many North Coast producers faced in 2008, not to mention consumers' tendency to stay away from wines that might give them headaches. This 50% Petite Sirah-based blend (there's Malbec and Cabernet Sauvignon, too) is a sledgehammer of a wine, all savory leather and dark blue fruit, with a velvety structure that'll linger a long time.\",\n",
       " 'A real disappointment, considering the fame of the vineyard and the fact that Castoro did a better job last year. The wine is thin and simple, with cola, cherry and spice flavors that finish hot.',\n",
       " 'A fine, copper- colored blush with intricate flavors of raspberries, rosehip tea, peach and cinnamon spice. Goes beyond simple rosé-ness to achieve complexity.',\n",
       " \"Showing Talley's distinctive elegance and brilliant structure, this Chard is a blend of the Rincon and Rosemary's vineyards. The wine's architecture really makes it special, with acidity and dusty tannins providing the bare bones to the lemon, lime, pineapple and mango fruit. A great wine to have with food.\",\n",
       " 'Only a fine, cool-climate vineyard could have grown this Pinot. It combines ripe raspberry, cherry and cola flavors with crispness and a delicate, silky mouthfeel. The end result is a dry, complex wine of considerable charm and a drink-me-again deliciousness.',\n",
       " \"Comes down on Petite Sirah's rustic, slightly sweet side. Even though the alcohol is pretty high, there's a sugary, porty finish to the blackberry and cherry jam flavors. The wine also has the bigtime tannins you expect from this variety, and should age for several years.\",\n",
       " \"A wine with bright, red and blue fruit notes that's full and structured, laced with pepper that gets better the longer you let it open up. The finish is long and has traces of sweet caramel and vanilla.\",\n",
       " 'Marked by strong, ripe fruit, this Cab is a bit one-dimensional. It offers waves of blackberries, cherries, raspberries and chocolate, with a rich coating of sweet, smoky oak, and has a soft, melted mouthfeel. Seems at its best now.',\n",
       " 'A fruit-forward, high-toned Pinot Gris, with straightforward pear fruit flavors.',\n",
       " \"Shows the crisp elegance and clean balance this bottling is known for, with ripe citrus, apricot, tropical fruit and mineral flavors, accented by rich new oak. It's fun to play with this Chard, let it warm up in the glass and see how it changes over the course of a dinner. That's the mark of a great table wine.\",\n",
       " 'Good for its apricot, vanilla and buttercream flavors, but really lacks the sweet richness that an expensive dessert wine needs. It falls apart mid-palate, and turns watery on the finish.',\n",
       " 'I like the dry balance, with its well-crafted tannins, brisk acidity and gentle touch of oak. But the taste is disappointingly thin, showing herb-dominated dill and tobacco, with just a splash of cherry fruit.',\n",
       " 'Lots of tart, almost sour acidity in this Sauvignon Blanc. Gets the tastebuds whistling with savory flavors of lemons, limes and gooseberries, and is bone dry through the finish. Nice appetizer wine.',\n",
       " \"This Tempranillo and Cabernet Sauvignon blend has rich blackberry, cherry, currant, licorice and sandalwood flavors. It's dry and quite acidic, with a tart, clean mouthfeel and a silky texture. Drink now.\",\n",
       " \"Glenora's Dry Riesling is intensely fruity with loads of juicy white peach and melon flavors, yet impeccably dry and crisp on the palate. Pure and pristine with a soft minerality that lingers from start to finish.\",\n",
       " 'Although the winery describes the oak on this wine as neutral, it seems to stick out. The flavors are dominated by buttered toast and vanilla honey. Then the lemons and limes kick in, with their undergirding of minerals. Gainey has good grapes, but needs to develop a better delineation between their regular and Limited Selection Sauvignon Blanc.',\n",
       " 'This is a very pretty wine, though not nearly as substantial as the 2009. Fruit flavors of strawberry and light cherry are set over tart acids. The palate softens up a bit and runs through a quick, clean fade.',\n",
       " \"The longer this wine breathes in the glass the better it gets. At first sip, it's obviously a very good wine, richly tannic and deeply impressive in blackberries, cassis and oak, with a firm minerality that grounds it. But as it warms and airs, the fascinating palate begins to unfold. Will age effortless for many years. Drink now–2020.\",\n",
       " \"An extremely pungent florality hits the nose on this sweeter bottling, with orange blossoms, strong white flowers and a quinine character. The palate is brightly sweet but far from overly done, with perfumed night jasmine mixing into more orange-blossom elements. Perhaps this wine is an acquired taste, but it's clean and crisp.\",\n",
       " 'A heavy, soft wine. It shows the weight, density and ripeness of a Santa Lucia Highlands Pinot Noir, with black cherry, mocha and spice flavors, but lacks delicacy and vivacity. Drink now.',\n",
       " \"Though soft on the finish, this is sharply herbal and stemmy, with woody flavors instead of fruit. There are traces of berry and cassis, but the nature of Cabernet Franc is to be herbal, and here it's in full bloom.\",\n",
       " 'This Pinot Grigio is simple and sweet. It tastes like a mixture of sugared fruit juices, brightened with lively acidity.',\n",
       " \"This Chardonnay is dry and offers brilliant acidity. At first, it's austere, but then the core of citrus and tropical fruits becomes apparent and intense. The nervy acidity leads to a tight, zesty finish.\",\n",
       " \"Shows the tight structure and hearty tannins of this mountain appellation, on the western side of Napa Valley. There's a huge core of ripe black currants, with a firm minerality. Give this fine wine four years in the cellar to soften and mellow, or decant now for a few hours.\",\n",
       " \"This is the winery's complement to the Grâce reserve, and the best of the new releases. Had I to choose, I'd give the nod to the Elégance. Pretty raspberry fruit is set against a strong streak of almond paste—marzipan. That almond pastry and sweet fruit carries cleanly into the finish.\",\n",
       " 'Impresses for the sheer power of ripeness, but also and especially for the structure. The flavors of blackberries, cherries, currants, cocoa, herbs and sweetly smoked oak are beautiful and complex, yet the tannin-acid balance is near perfect. This single-vineyard wine is one of the finest Sonoma County Cabernets of the vintage. Should age effortlessly through 2014, growing purer and more elegant.',\n",
       " \"It's awfully hard to make a really good Pinot Noir for less than, say, $30. This wine tries hard. It shows true Pinot character in the dry, silky mouthfeel, crisp acids and pleasant fruit flavors, which finish with coffee and cocoa.\",\n",
       " 'Shows the big, potent blackberry, blueberry, chocolate and spice flavors of those luscious Malbecs from Argentina, with significant tannins that make the finish tough. Could open up in a few years. Best with rich beef dishes.',\n",
       " \"Enormously ripe berries characterize this wine; it explodes with wild raspberries, cherries, blackberries and dark chocolate, with a peppery, minty finish. But it's young and vigorous in rich, dense tannins, suggesting ageability. Best now, with decanting, and for several years.\",\n",
       " 'Dry, tannic and thin. Whatever fruit there used to be has dropped out, leaving behind alcohol and the ghost of black currants.',\n",
       " \"This is what good, cool-climate Chardonnay tastes like without oak barrel influence. It's a dry, crisply acidic and strongly flavored wine, bursting with ripe pineapples, peaches, green apples and vanilla.\",\n",
       " 'This is rich and generously spiced, smelling and tasting like chocolate, vanilla, smoke and blackberries. Aging for 19 months in American and French oak certainly boosted the spices. It tastes full-bodied, very deep and almost sweet in flavor, with moderate tannins to lend some support.',\n",
       " 'This is quite light, almost ephemeral, with tart raspberry and red licorice flavors and a strong metallic/mineral streak. It is delicately made, and interesting, but comparable to a simple Bourgogne rather than a wine priced at this level.',\n",
       " \"Here's a big, sumptuous, fat, oily Chardonnay, massive in tropical fruits, spices, minerals and smoky buttered toast. The creamy texture makes it feel especially rich. Aged in 57% new oak, it's truly a decadent—but balanced—Chardonnay.\",\n",
       " 'A Bordeaux blend based on Merlot, this soft, juicy wine is likeable for drinking now. It has luscious black cherry, cassis and cherry liqueur flavors, with a milk chocolate finish.',\n",
       " 'Rich and dry, with pleasant blackberry, cherry, currant and cedar flavors. Sometimes Central Coast Cabs can be green, but not this one. An elegant, complex wine for drinking now and through 2012.',\n",
       " \"Biodynamic grapegrowing and stainless-steel fermentation have collaborated to produce this fresh, keen and brilliant young Sauvignon Blanc. It's so clean and zesty in acidity, you can't help but admire it, and the flavors only add to the attraction. Lemon, lime and grapefruit citrus have richer notes of figs, melons and vanilla. This is really a gorgeous, dry white wine.\",\n",
       " 'Super-ripe in tropical papaya, pineapple and white peach flavors, with a charry, caramel sweetness that seems to come from oak. Sweet clove and anise on the finish.',\n",
       " 'A drinkable Merlot at this price is noteworthy; this one, with its aromas of berries, toast and herbs—even tomatoes—will make lots of friends. Tart cherry-berry fruit and earth is smooth on the palate and blends in some tea notes on the abbreviated finish. Best Buy.',\n",
       " 'Trisaetum is making some of the most exciting Rieslings in Oregon; now it can add Pinot Noir to its hit list. Estate grown, elegant and showing more than a little new French oak, this toasty wine drinks like a young Chambolle-Musigny. The tannins are sculpted and firm; the fruit ripe and racy with a mélange of red berries and currants. Give this more time in the bottle to absorb the new oak and shed some of the herbal aromas.',\n",
       " \"This is quite a rich wine, and although it can't quite overcome Petite Sirah's rustic character, it is a great example of the variety. Fully dry and full-bodied, with thick tannins, it's filled with blackberry, black cherry and mocha flavors, with a meaty edge.\",\n",
       " \"This is 96% Cabernet Franc, and why the winery doesn't just call a spade a spade is beyond me. But that quibble aside, there is much to recommend here. The fruit is plenty ripe and tastes of strawberry, raspberry and cherry preserves. The oak flavors bring on the smoke and toast, and the natural tendency of Cab Franc to impart green coffee bean notes is also much in evidence. The tannins have been softened up, but still leave a lingering green tea impression in the back of the throat.\",\n",
       " 'Strawberry fruit is mixed in with fresh, pungent herbs—a mix that nicely expresses the Chehalem Mountains terroir. Fruity, full and forward, this ripe and pleasing wine is balanced just right for near-term enjoyment.',\n",
       " 'A bit raw and rustic, with stalky flavors of black cherries, sage and black pepper. Okay with everyday fare.',\n",
       " 'Fragrant and lush with floral/citrus aromas, this stainless-fermented Chardonnay is inviting and seductive. Brilliant, bright fruit anchors a wine that is tense and dense and vividly thrilling. The acids are natural and flavors seamlessly run from lemon/lime to pineapple to orange, and keep on keeping on, with fresh, water-washed rock in the finish.',\n",
       " \"Really young now, this vineyard block bottling needs a little time to come into its own. Tasted in February, a combination of acidity and bottle shock has made it brittle. But it's a very good wine, deliciously flavored, with a medium-bodied silkiness and Pinot's exotic sensuality.\",\n",
       " 'Good, solid, chunky aromas of berry and chocolate lead into ripe, spicy raspberry and cherry fruit. The wine is loaded with creamy, milk chocolaty oak. Smooth and broad, it coats the palate. Though not a deep or textured effort, the fruit and smooth mouthfeel make for plenty of near-term enjoyment. There is just enough weight to give the impression of extra ripeness, a plus in this price range.',\n",
       " 'A beautiful Pinot Noir. So dry and elegant, so light and crisp in the mouth, and yet so complex. Continues a string of impressive wines from this remote vineyard. Shows mineral-inflected cherry, currant and cola flavors, in a full-bodied wine with great density and finish. Now–2016, at least.',\n",
       " 'Old-vine Oregon Zinfandel is not common; in fact, this is all of them. From the Pines Vineyard, planted around a century ago, revived in the 1980s, these wines have a power and unique presence that sets them apart from Zin from anywhere else. Ultraripe fruit flavors of strawberry and raspberry jam, alcohol above 15%, amazing density and beautifully managed tannins, with some sweet grain flavors that say “old vines.”',\n",
       " 'Quite dry on the palate, this seductive Riesling exhibits aromas of honeyed ginger with a hint of smoke and petrol. Lime and apple flavors combine with a zippy acidity and subtle minerality throughout.',\n",
       " \"Give this one some time to breathe, as it's a bit tight on opening. With a relatively modest 13.5% alcohol, it's not as ripe as some Napa Cabs, and it's also fairly tannic. There's an astringent, tea-like edge to the cassis and cherries. Finely structured and bone dry, this Cab should develop well over the next eight years.\",\n",
       " \"Big in flavor, with a touch of ripely rounded heat, this wine dances in coconut and black olive flavors, a sweet savoriness that's enhanced by cedar and pencil seasonings. The finish comes with a bittersweet taste of tobacco.\",\n",

    "To train our model, we are going to have to convert all of our categorical features (i.e. text) into continuous features (i.e. numbers). This is a very common process that is performed for training Machine Learning models, as features are often categorical in datasets. Machine Learning algorithms work purely with numbers to perform various tasks such as regression (e.g. predicting housing prices when given the square footage and location of a house) and classification (e.g. predicting whether or not a tumor is malignant, given the mass of the tumor). We will convert all of the categorical features except for the description feature, which we will touch on this in a bit."
