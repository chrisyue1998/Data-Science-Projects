       " 'An interesting wine that shows its warm terroir in the softness and baked fruit quality. The flavors, wrapped in gentle tannins, are of cherry pie, black currants, cocoa and tobacco, and the finish is dry. The natural acidity makes the wine clean and food-friendly.',\n",
       " \"This hommage to Pauillac is darkly colored and powerful, with flavors of black currants and a decadent, dark chocolate note. There's lots of flamboyant oak. Texturally, it's soft in acids, with melted, smooth tannins, and the finish is dry. It's a delicious, interesting wine, and a testament to J. Lohr's ambitions with Cabernet Sauvignon. Drink now.\",\n",
       " 'Rich and oaky, with crisp acidity framing flavors of pineapple crème brûlée, yellow apricot jam, buttered toast and meringue. Flamboyant, but controlled and elegant. Drink now.',\n",
       " \"Marked by aggressive acidity and some dusty tannins, this Pinot is not showing well now. It's just too hard and tart. But the flavors are enormously ripe, and the finish is dry and silky and long. It all suggests cellaring to let the cherries, black raspberries and Dr. Pepper cola emerge from their tomb. Better after 2011.\",\n",
       " \"Not a bad Chard from this warm Central Coast region. It's a little rough around the edges, but is dry and creamy, with a nice mingling of fruit and oaky elements.\",\n",
       " \"This is quite a mouthfilling Zin. From old vines, it's rich in flavor, with notes of blackberry jam, cassis, espresso, dark bitter chocolate and anise. It's on the soft side. A hefty amount of new French oak contributes sweet tannins and toast to this full-bodied, zesty wine.\",\n",
       " 'The first bottle was off, with an unpleasant mousy aroma. A second bottle fared a bit better, showing simple citrus and sour melon flavors. It finishes a bit thin.',\n",
       " 'Unfortunately underripe, with an asparagus and pepper taste to the coffee and currants. Lacks fruity richness.',\n",
       " \"A very fine wine that strikes just the right balance in a white Bordeaux-style wine. It's fruity in the California style, with ripe citrus, apple and peach flavors. The richness is balanced with zesty acidity, and there's a dry, steely minerality that makes it particularly savory.\",\n",
       " \"Organically grown and selected from a mix of specific vineyard blocks, Rex Hill's reserve is rather light in 2007, with tannins that are a bit out of proportion to the fruit. It's a carefully controlled effort, but thin and dilute, with strawberry/watermelon fruit and some tomato leaf creeping into the finish.\",\n",
       " \"A very likeable Cabernet Sauvignon, easily up there with the best of Easton's Cabs. The wine is dry and rich in fruit, with finely ground tannins housing ripe blackberry and black currant flavors. Should develop in the bottle over the next 2–4 years.\",\n",
       " 'Rich and full-bodied, this has the weight of a barrel-fermented, lees-aged wine. This 100% Pinot Blanc has plenty of orange, cream, brown sugar and brown butter flavors. Try it as an interesting alternative to Chardonnay.',\n",
       " 'A lovely, fragrant wine that shows the spices and exotic floral and tropical fruit notes of this variety. Crisp in acidity, it finishes just a little off-dry.',\n",
       " \"Already tasting a little old and tired, with the fruit fading and turning mushroomy. But it's not unpleasant, with a dried fruit spiciness. Drink quickly before it disappears.\",\n",
       " \"Dry and tannic compared to today's lush, over-the-top Napa style, this Cabernet-based Bordeaux blend hearkens back to the old Inglenook and Martini Cabs, which were ready to drink on release, yet aged for a long time. It's a lovely wine, with rich cassis, pencil lead and cedar flavors that finish with complexity and elegance. Best now and for a good 10 years or more.\",\n",
       " \"Soft and jammy, with raspberry and red licorice flavors and a streak of brambles, nettles and peppery spices. It's a good, dry wine, but would benefit from greater structure. A Syrah-based Rhône-style blend.\",\n",
       " 'New oak bursts forth in an immediate blast of smoky char, while airing reveals lemonddrop, honeysuckle, buttercream and fresh spice notes. The wine is marvelously complicated, zesty in acidity, with all kinds of fruit, flower and spice flavors. Represents a whole new dimension in California Viognier.',\n",
       " \"For the first time this popular blend contains no Yakima Valley fruit. The savvy blend of Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot and Syrah works like a charm. Outside of the Ste. Michelle brands, this is probably the most consistent, balanced and expressive red wine blend that is value-priced and widely available from Washington state. It's elegant, somewhat European in style, with light, polished fruit flavors of plum, berry and cherry.\",\n",
       " 'A pretty rose/salmon color, scented with cinnamon spice. Done as a saignée, barrel-fermented and bone-dry, this is delicate and yet persistent, with ripe peach highlights.',\n",
       " 'Semi-sweet and soft, with pyrazine aromas and sour lemon and pineapple flavors, this Sauvignon Blanc leaves a lot to be desired.',\n",
       " \"From the Happy Canyon area, this 100% Cabernet shows the ripeness this warmer eastern appellation brings to the grapes. It's rich, dry and attractive in blackberries, black currants and oak, with mineral and herbal complexities and very refined tannins. Should age well for up to six years.\",\n",
       " 'Heavy, sweet and super-oaky, like a liquid infusion of buttered popcorn, pineapple jam and vanilla meringue. Will appeal to many, but purists will find it heavy-handed and manipulated.',\n",
       " \"Benessere's Sangiovese tests the limits of the variety's ability to thrive in Napa Valley, with good results year after year. The '05 is dry and intricate, with ripe, complex flavors of cherries with the bitter skins and red currants. Refined tannins provide structural integrity. Best now through 2011.\",\n",
       " \"Based on Oakville fruit, Vecina is not quite as fruit-driven as the other two Bond wines. It's a bit backward, with an earthy, mushroomy, soy and balsamic taste alongside the briary berry flavors. Has an almost feral quality that is quite interesting and different. With its big backsplash of tannins, it might age best of the current trio. Drink now–2020.\",\n",
       " \"Supple and layered, this nicely captures the scope and scale of this superb vintage. It's still young, tight and quite compact, but shows threads of tobacco, anise, stone and pencil lead, along with full, fleshy, plum and cassis fruit. Great structure and dense, ripe tannins. This is a perfect illustration of why Washington Merlot can claim to be the best in the world outside of Pomerol.\",\n",
       " 'The distinctive aroma resembles tamarind, cranberries and new oak barrels. Flavors are bright and pure, and the mouthfeel is firm with tannins while staying smooth and velvety. This is very tasty and unique, made in a full-bodied style. Zinfandel and Primitivo make up 77% of it, along with Barbera and Petite Sirah.',\n",
       " \"A good, lusty wine, although it's too young now, offering a big mouthful of tannins, acidity and immature fruit. A blend of 99% Cab and 1% Petit Verdot, it's a hard wine, but the flavors are immaculate, suggesting ripe blackberries and currants that veer into a touch of raisin. Give it 4–5 years in the cellar to come around.\",\n",
       " 'Big, toothsome wine, chewy and assertive. Cline fans will recognize the style: brambly, peppery, with enormous vitality and punch. Bright, spicy fruit backed with good acids and just enough toast.',\n",
       " \"You have to count this as another great Insignia, dry and complex and ageworthy, although the tannins are fierce now, and it may lack just a bit of the glamor of, say, the 2004 or 2001. It's certainly a big wine that floods the mouth with blackberry, black currant, cassis and new oak flavors. The tannins and acids make it aloof, resistant, tough. It wants time in the cellar. Best after 2013. Production was a hefty 13,500 cases.\",\n",
       " \"A Pinot-Syrah-Merlot blend that doesn't really go anywhere. It's stiff and herbal, stemmy and tannic, with no resolution of the various varietal fruit flavors. Red, tart and tannic.\",\n",
       " \"Concentrated and lush, livelier and better than the producer's 2007 which still needs time to develop, this reserve-level Cab with small amounts of Petit Verdot, Malbec, Carmènere and Cabernet Franc is ready to drink now, its cassis and cranberry fruit showing well.\",\n",
       " \"This Cabernet-based blend has some pedigreed vineyard fruit in it, including Tokalon and Beckstoffer Georges III. It's extremely soft and complex, but not showing all that well at this moment. Seems a bit closed down, muted. But it's a very fine wine that probably needs time to open. Drink 2008–2010.\",\n",
       " 'Full-bodied, soft and approachable, with rich aromas of vanilla, graham cracker and chocolate overlaid on flavors of cassis and cherry. Clove notes accent fine tannins on the finish.',\n",
       " \"Weedy, with some bell pepper and herb aromas, cassis and tobacco. Elegantly lean and graceful in the mouth, the wine ends in a long, spicy finish. You might rate it even higher if you don't mind some herbaceousness.\",\n",
       " 'Fans of CC will find a wine with the balance of previous vintages. It refuses to be a fruit bomb, but offers a wealth of sumptuous blackberry and cherry liqueur flavors that pull back at the last moment under a blanket of youthful tannins. Not a long-term ager, but should hold for 6 years, and is easy to find, with more than 13,000 cases produced.',\n",
       " \"A very finely crafted Pinot Noir, although it's also very young and wants some time in the cellar. Combines great Highlands fruit power and tannic structure with a silky, delicate mouthfeel. Beautiful now for the elaborate raspberry and cherry flavors, elaborated with beautiful oak, but better after 2013.\",\n",
       " \"Just a handful of varietal Counoise is made in Washington; this being the latest, and blended with 25% Syrah. Labeled Columbia Valley, it's nonetheless mostly Walla Walla grapes from the Forgotten Hills vineyard. A unique wine, with light strawberry fruit, strong natural acids, light tannins, and some of the spiciness of Carmenère.\",\n",
       " 'A very good dessert wine, whose acidity provides balance to the sweet apricot, orange, vanilla and honeysuckle flavors. A bit of tease, it would score far higher with greater intensity.',\n",
       " 'This blend is comprised of seven varieties that were sourced from nine vineyards. Despite a hint of green in the tannins and a bit of stem in the fruits, this shows good complexity. Streaks of earth, mineral and licorice mingle around notes of dried cherry and fig.',\n",
       " \"The aroma suggests a ton of oak, and that impression carries over to the flavors. Butterscotch, buttered toast, caramel, crème brûlée, they're all tasty, but you don't want them to dominate, and here, they do. The underlying flavors of pineapples are swamped.\",\n",
       " \"Cab Franc is the main grape here, and it generates an even darker, more leafy and earthy companion to the winery's other Cab. The tannins are smoky and granular, with lots of coffee and stem flavors. But as always, the winemaking is excellent, the balance impeccable, and the grapes have been very carefully managed. The fruit, though tart and tight, is there, with cassis and purple plum flavors dominant.\",\n",
       " 'Great value for the price, with blackberry marmalade, moo shu plum sauce, tobacco, leather and pepper flavors that turn richly tannic and spicy in the finish. Shows lots of elegance and finesse.',\n",
       " 'Sharp in minty acidity and sweet, this Cab comes across as rustic. Tastes like a blackberry, chocolate and licorice energy bar you buy in the health food store.',\n",
       " \"A rustic, common wine; it's not quite ripe, and is hot in alcohol and pepper. But it's okay for everyday pizza and such.\",\n",
       " \"This Merlot straddles that interesting line between easy, everyday drinking and real complexity. It's dry and richly tannic, and is the sort of wine that won't win a blind tasting, but leaves you reaching for a third glass with that steak.\",\n",
       " \"It's called extra dry, but it's actually kind of sweet. Not too much, just enough to give a rich, honeyed edge to the strawberry, peach, nectarine and toast flavors.\",\n",
       " \"This vigorous young wine delivers all the Petite Sirah personality you could ask for. It's dark, dry and tannic, and huge in pepper-inspired flavors of blackberries, roasted coffee, cassis and an exquisitely sweet, spicy taste of gingersnap cookie. Should age effortlessly for a decade.\",\n",
       " \"Simple and fruity, with tart citrus flavors, like a lemon and lime fruit drink. Not much going on, but it's clean, dry and zesty.\",\n",
       " \"The Del Rio vineyard, in southern Oregon's Rogue Valley AVA, has pioneered the cultivation of Syrah in that part of the Northwest. As the vines acquire some age, they are coming into focus, and the rough tannins seem to be more in balance with the fruit. These wines are somewhat similar in style to the Syrahs from the Okanagan valley of Canada, and they offer an earthy mix of flavor that puts the fruit under earth, soy, coffee and smoke. Tannins in this Tyrus Evan are beautifully managed, with the edges sanded down, and the wine has a lovely, lingering presence on the palate.\",\n",
       " \"This estate vineyard wine's complex nose melds mineral, spice and lime aromas with herb and floral notes. It handles the disparate elements gracefully, showing body but not weight, and has a soft, almost tender mouthfeel. There's a touch of floral sweetness in the mouth—as on the nose—offset by earthy, mineral flavors on a lithe frame. This wine shows real subtlety, but leaves us wishing for more depth. Finishes light, dry and flinty.\",\n",
       " 'A little tough and sweet, but offers a solid mouthful of blackberries and cherries. Production was 175,000 cases.',\n",
       " \"A full-on Bordeaux blend, with 61% Cab Sauvignon, 19% Merlot, 11% Cab Franc and 9% Petit Verdot. Tight and slatey, it's got firm, hard—but certainly ripe—tannins wrapped around concentrated cassis and mulberry fruit. It's very well made but can use some softening up; a few more years will add to its complexity and develop its bouquet.\",\n",
       " \"This isn't one of your tropical fruit and oak, acidic cool-climate monster Chards. It's soft and earthy, with a dried sage and oregano edge to the green apple and white peach flavors.\",\n",
       " \"An enormous Petite Sirah, sweetly rich and explosive. Shows very ripe, sugared blackberry, milk chocolate, beef jerky and black pepper flavors, wrapped into smooth tannins. Too soft to age, it's a wine to drink now.\",\n",
       " \"Lovely juice, a concentrated mouthful of cranberry and raspberry fruit, from the Forgotten Hills vineyard. It's a perfectly delineated composite of rock, herb and tart fruit, all in proportion. A take-no-prisoners style, with plenty of stem and herb in the mix. Above all, elegant.\",\n",
       " 'Oaky and tannic, marked by caramel flavors that dominate the blackberries, black currants, cherries and chocolate. Feels heavy now, but improves in the glass. Decant, or try holding for a few years to see what happens.',\n",
       " 'This is three fifths Merlot, with the other four Bordeaux grapes filling out the rest. 100% French oak was used, half new, and the near-15% alcohol shows in a bit of burn in the finish. Toasty, smoky, laden with roasted coffee and bitter chocolate notes, this is a wine to pair with a grilled steak.',\n",
       " 'A very nice Chardonnay marked by crisp dryness and fine structure, which highlights the pleasant varietal flavors. Offers a nice array of pineapples, peaches, apricots and green apples, accented by the smoky vanilla of oak and grounded in minerals.',\n",
       " 'Mostly Malbec (34%) and Petit Verdot (32%), this nonvintage blend offers up-front oak notes of vanilla and dill. These are followed by cherry cola, green herbs and a whiff of volatility, along with sweet flavors and grippy tannins.',\n",
       " 'Rich in acids, ripe in fruit and balanced, with a silky texture, this is a very pretty Pinot Noir for drinking now. It has ripe, dry flavors of wild forest raspberries and cherries, bacon, sautéed mushrooms and cola.',\n",
       " \"Rustic and sharp in unevenly ripened tannins, with some green, minty flavors right beside sweet, jammy ones of raspberries and cola. Zin's spices are there, bigtime.\",\n",
       " 'The Horse Heaven Vineyard adds a welcome touch of minerality to the plain apple fruit flavor of the wine. It is this minerality that elevates it a notch, giving it a textural and refreshing mouthfeel.',\n",
       " \"Despite 15.1% alcohol, this is dull, one dimensional and rather light. The tannins are a little beefed up, but there's marginal fruit and everything seems a bit out of whack.\",\n",
       " 'This is 100% Syrah from Kiona vineyards, on Red Mountain. It pins the meter at 15% alcohol without tiring out the palate. Silky and substantial, with flavors of raspberry, black cherry and red licorice, and scents of violets, rose petals and hints of cracked pepper.',\n",
       " 'More properly understood as a dessert wine, this Muscat is sweet and clean in acidity. It offers luscious flavors of orange essence, vanilla and honey.',\n",
       " 'A five-grape Bordeaux-style blend, this has a scent of rose water that drifts above earthier notes and tart berry flavors. Tight and focused, it finishes with a lick of cola and espresso.',\n",
       " 'Black olive, boysenberry, graphite and cracked pepper season up a slightly gamy nose on this bottling from a popular Los Alamos vineyard. The flavors are a study of blackness, with peppercorns, asphalt and deep purple fruits that are both dark and tart, all framed by a boisterous acidity.',\n",
       " \"A bone-dry, slightly green Sauvignon Blanc, with lemongrass and gooseberry flavors, boosted with vibrant acidity. Feels elegant and sleek, but won't appeal to everyone. The grapes for this unoaked wine came from Sonoma and Lake counties.\",\n",
       " 'Soft and oaky, this is a simple Chardonnay with more than its share of buttery oak. Flavors are cracker, toast, buttered nuts; there is little impact from the fruit.',\n",
       " \"Silky smooth, dry and classy, this Pinot shows great coastal personality in its tannins, crisp acidity and ripe flavors of cherries, cola, raspberries, pomegranates, orange zest and sweet rhubarb. That acidity is fresh and tart. Doesn't seem likely to improve, so decant. Should be nice with roast salmon, lamb chops or a great grilled steak.\",\n",
       " \"Tough, hard and dry, with thick tannins and a cut of acidity that obscure deep flavors of blackberries, black licorice and black pepper. This chewy wine could develop over the next 2–3 years, but right now, it's pretty unrelieved.\",\n",
       " 'Chewy tannins surround an elegant, structured wine, classic in red cassis, licorice and woody herbs. Powerful, it retains balance from start to finish, exuding the warmth of the vintage with the relative coolness of the appellation, marrying the two sides expertly together.',\n",
       " 'Fermentation was done in a mix of stainless steel and French oak, yielding a soft, accessible, lightly spiced wine. Flavors mix notes of fresh cut grass and celery with melony fruit.',\n",
       " 'Though the aromas show a stemmy, green character, pea vine and earth, rather than fruit, there is just enough raspberry and tart cassis fruit to hold things together. Could accommodate a burger or a pizza.',\n",
       " \"A massive wine, just tremendous. Made from 97% Chardonnay and 3% Viognier, it's extraordinarily rich and concentrated in grilled pineapple, pear, peach and lime flavors, with a coating of sweet, vanilla-scented crême brûlée. There's an authoritative minerality all the way through that grounds and sustains the fruit. The grapes come from warmer vineyards throughout Santa Barbara County.\",\n",
       " \"This winery's style always has been to produce food-friendly wines, and this one certainly is. Sommeliers might want to check it out as an interesting alternative to Zinfandel. It's dry and high in acidity but very fruity, with a range of blackberry, currant, raisin, licorice and pepper flavors.\",\n",
       " 'Rich flavors of peaches, pears, buttercream and toast appear in this dry Chardonnay, which shows no signs of tiredness, although many 2007s do. The chief problem is excessive softness. It lacks balancing acidity and brightness.',\n",
       " 'Not showing well now due to tough, gritty tannins and unintegrated fruit and oak flavors that taste jammy sweet in raspberries, cherries and mocha, like a little fruit pastry. All the parts seem to be there to age. Try towards 2011.',\n",
       " 'A little too soft and sweet for balance, with flavors like the melted filling of pineapple tart, lemon meringue pie and vanilla custard. Alcohol adds a nice, balancing burn.',\n",
       " 'The vineyard is in the heart of the Rutherford bench. The wine is rich in fruit and tannins, but a bit clumsy, with a chunky, tannic mouthfeel and jammy, direct blackberry and blueberry fruit flavors. Not ready for drinking now, but well-made, and should age well, as Cabs from this stretch tend to have a long life.',\n",
       " 'Lots of rich, forward pineapple, ripe pear jam, vanilla cream and buttered toast flavors in this Chardonnay. It will satisfy your sweet tooth, with its honey-rich finish. Drink now.',\n",
       " 'Very ripe and extracted, with red and black currant, carob and licorice flavors veering into raisins. But it finishes dry and clean.',\n",
       " \"Soft and one-dimensional, this red Rhône blend has flavors of cherries, blackberry jam, blueberry pie, chocolate and pepper. There's some bitterness throughout that detracts.\",\n",
       " 'Fresh and apple-y on the nose with a bright shower of lemon-lime acidity, this off-dry Riesling is an excellent everyday wine with abundant apple and citrus flavors and a hint of sweet spice.',\n",
       " \"This is a very good wine. Made from Zinfandel, Cabernet Sauvignon, Syrah, Petite Sirah and Syrah, from around the state, it's absolutely dry, rich in tannic structure, and complex, with cherry, berry, tobacco, cedar and spice flavors. An excellent and versatile food wine, at a great price.\",\n",
       " \"This is a Merlot-dominated Bordeaux blend. Along with pleasant, strawberry fruit you'll find scents of candied roses and hints of fresh herb. The length and detail bespeak a wine with medium-term aging potential. Baking spices dominate the finish, with a burst of heat from the near-15% alcohol.\",\n",
       " 'The nose could pass for Médoc; it has the depth and complexity, the tight cassis fruit, the hints of cedar and lead pencil. In the mouth it is firm, tannic and refined, with elegant flavors of leather and earth. Not a huge wine, but stylish, and a fine example of how Washington can emulate the flavors of Bordeaux.',\n",
       " 'A solid Syrah, bone dry and well-rounded, with strong tannins that call for a rich steak. The flavors are earthy, suggesting blackberries, cherries, herbs, sweet leather and pepper. Drink now through 2010.',\n",
       " 'From a single block at Temperance Hill, this aromatic wine neatly captures the terroir without pushing too hard. There are herbal nuances. a hint of hazelnut, some earth and wet stone, all nicely blended into a wine that is robust but accessible. Good balance and well-managed tannins.',\n",
       " \"This is the first Easton Pinot Noir ever reviewed in this magazine, and it's a promising start for the winery, which is known for Zinfandel. Shows Pinot's dryness and silky texture, and proper flavors of raspberries, red currants, cola, spices and cedar. The next step, if Easton is ambitious, is to build in complexity.\",\n",
       " 'A thoroughly good Cabernet that represents a welcome return to form after a disappointing period for the winery in the mid-2000s. Dry, rich and dramatically structured, this cellarworthy wine has impressive flavors of blackberries and cassis, with earthier notes of black olive tapenade and cedarwood. Could easily score even higher down the road.',\n",
       " 'Tart in acidity, with simple cherry flavors that taste baked into a pie. But the finish is fully dry. Tannic, too, with the result that the mouthfeel is hard as nails.',\n",
       " \"This is an enormously rich, extracted wine, that's vast in cherries, blackberries, currants, chocolate and oak flavors. Yet it has balancing acidity and tannins. Best now and over the next few years, especially a great barbecued steak or leg of lamb.\",\n",
       " \"Soft and fruity, this easy-drinking Syrah has pleasant, jammy flavors of raspberries, blackberries, cola, bacon and peppery spices. It's a nice, full-bodied red wine to drink now with party food.\",\n",
       " 'Expensive, but brilliant. At the forefront of California Sauvignon Blanc. Shows bright and clean acidity framing intense tangerine, lime and honey flavors, as well as complications from oak. Yet it finishes bone dry and elegant. Delicious and compelling, this wine lifts Sauvignon Blanc into entirely new territory.',\n",
       " \"Here's a good buy in a big, rich, decadently delicious Syrah. Soft and dry, with refined tannins, it offers flavors of currants, blackberries, cherries, chocolate, licorice, Dr. Pepper cola, black pepper and spices. Easy to like, yet complex.\",\n",
       " \"Ultrarich and fruity, this Cabernet shows the grapey ripeness Paso Robles is famous for. The wine is fresh and jammy in blackberries, cherries and raspberries. It's a little one-dimensional, and the alcohol is very high, but not hot. Drink now.\",\n",
       " \"A blend of Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling and Pinot Gris. It's crisp and clean in acidity, with zesty flavors of pineapples, oranges, mangoes and vanilla. If only it were drier, the score would be much higher.\",\n",
       " 'Softly appealing, with rich flavors of raspberries, cherries and spices. Oak barrel aging adds textured notes of vanilla, smoke and caramel. A pretty, polished Pinot Noir for drinking now.',\n",
       " 'Although it has a delicate structure, that feels almost lace-like on the palate, this light-bodied Riesling bursts with concentrated ripe peach and apricot flavors. Semisweet in style, this has vibrant acidity and an oyster-shell- and stone-like minerality that lingers on the long finish.',\n",
       " 'Zippy and fresh with a gentle prickle on the tongue, this dry Riesling smells of sweet, fresh apples laced with just a hint of petrol. On the palate, soft apple and pear flavors are edged with slate and stones, and a shower of fresh lime on the finish.',\n",
       " 'This blend of Mourvèdre, Grenache and Syrah—the three loves, get it?—is dry and fine. It has real complexity, mingling tart cherry skin and blackberry flavors with earthy coffee, tobacco, spices and herbs. Best now.',\n",
       " 'A good, fairly complex California Chardonnay, marked by ripe, jammy orange, pear and apricot fruit flavors. Winemaker interventions also play roles, with the malolactic fermentation adding buttery notes and French oak contributing sweet caramel.',\n",
       " \"The '04 Spottswoode shows the enormous ripeness of the vintage, with lush currant, blackberry jam, chocolate-covered cherry candy and spice flavors, plus an earthier note of sweet green olive tapenade. For all that voluptuous flavor, the wine maintains great structure. Very good now, it will gradually evolve through at least 2012.\",\n",
       " \"The winery has a mixed record with Cabernet and this release doesn't advance the cause. It's sharp in acids, with stalky, green notes, and the thinness of flavor accentuates the tannins, making them astringent.\",\n",
       " \"The 2005 Ursa is similar in style to the previous blends – 55% Merlot, 28% Cab Franc, 7% Cabernet Sauvignon, 7% Malbec and 3% Petit Verdot. A nice ripe vintage, it's a beefy version of this popular Bordeaux blend, with more black fruits than red, and somewhat rugged, substantial, lightly earthy tannins. As always, it remains forward and accessible, drinking quite nicely, but a bit more cellar worthy in this excellent vintage.\",\n",
       " 'A little raw in acidity, with some green olive notes, but the rustic nature works in favor of the wine, grounding its rich blackberry, currant and chocolate flavors with earthiness. Tasted in a flight of much more expensive wines, this Cab did very well.',\n",
       " \"A very nice effort at this price, it's smooth and supple, with surprising chocolaty notes (surprising because the winemaker insists that no new oak was used). It's developing more quickly than Sheridan's higher-priced wines, but drinking very well right now, showing the forward, delicious, mixed fruit flavors of this extremely warm vintage.\",\n",
       " \"This is the richest of Diatom's 2009 unoaked Chards. It's wildly expressive in tangerines, white truffles and honey, braced with a pleasing minerality. The alcohol is quite high, but an integral part of the wine's oily, glyceriney mouthfeel.\",\n",
       " 'This Grenache-based Rhône blend is dry and simple, with apricot and cherry flavors and some cleansing acidity. This is a pleasantly rustic sipper that finishes clean and brisk.',\n",
       " 'Tannic and fruity, with a raw mouthfeel, this dry young wine is meant to wash down steaks, chops and so forth. Not likely to age, so drink now. Cabernet, Merlot, Sangiovese and Petite Sirah.',\n",
       " 'This soft, high-toned wine is more than a little sweet— either a stuck fermentation or intentional residual sugar. Strawberry candy, cracker, and a hint of sweat in the finish.',\n",
       " 'This outstanding Walla Walla boutique has established a track record for consistent improvement, and the white wines are best of show. Once again this 2006 blend is smooth, round and richly endowed with mixed stone fruits. Lovely aromas build a dense cloud of complex fruit, toast and caramel scents around the glass; once in the mouth the full-bodied fruit takes hold with lychee, peach and stone fruits. Immaculate and persistent, this stunning wine just keeps on coming.',\n",
       " 'Hot and raw, with a chili pepper heat despite officially low alcohol. The flavors are modest and dry, suggesting caramelized cherries and cola.',\n",
       " 'This is spicy and sharp, with high-toned fruit flavors of berry and currant. Acids are strong and provide good focus, with a spicy/peppery note resonating through the finish.',\n",
       " \"Clean, dry and crisp in acidity, this wine has citrus and fig flavors, with an edge of tangy gooseberry. It's nice and elegant, but finishes a little thin.\",\n",
       " \"The '06 was a 16% monster, but delicious. The '07 is just as good, but swings less of a hammer. Alcohol is 14.8%, yet the wine comes across as the concentrated essence of raspberries and cherries, lifted with all-natural acids, and showing a piercing core that just keeps on going.\",\n",
       " 'Strong blueberry and black-cherry aromas mesh with cedar spice and tobacco ash on this rather elegant nose. A balsamic blueberry reduction flavor shows on the palate, where fine-grained tannins also present smashed vanilla flavors.',\n",
       " 'Well-structured, with firm tannins and acids framing herb, cherry and blond tobacco flavors, with just a touch of smoky oak. The dry finish makes it particularly elegant.',\n",
       " 'Burgundian technique was used in this wine, and the aromas and tastes of those techniques dominate. The wine is heavy in leesy, yeasty, toasted oak notes, which dominate, rather than subtlely support, the underlying fruit.',\n",
       " \"Dry and rather scoury, with a rough mouthfeel. But it's clean and bone dry, and shows proper sparkling wine flavors of citrus, vanilla, yeast and green apple.\",\n",
       " \"Simple and a little one-dimensional in fruit and spice flavors, this dessert wine's main feature is sweetness. It has a flavor like the syrup from canned peaches.\",\n",
       " 'A little soft and herbal, in the way of certain Sonoma Cabernets, but incredibly rich, offering a heady array of flavors. Blackberries, blueberries, chocolate, sweet red licorice, pepper and toasty oak all mingle and make the wine rewardingly delicious. Seems best now and for the next few years.',\n",
       " \"This sturdy red is a blend of four Bordeaux grapes, with a tannic, earthy structure. It has the sort of rugged power that you'd look for in a café wine, ready to take on a juicy burger and some fries.\",\n",
       " 'Two-thirds Cabernet and one-third Syrah, this is a creative blend of Cayuse grapes, with the pungent, herbal, earthy character that the En Cerise vineyard delivers in spades. The fruit is a mix that hints at peaches, citrus and more, with an undercurrent of black olive and smoke. But the overriding flavors come from spice, herb, earth and rock.',\n",
       " 'The blend is mostly Merlot, with Syrah and Cabernet Sauvignon filling it out. Plenty of stuffing here, with the tannic structure of a pricier wine. Black cherry fruit, some well-modulated bark and herb, and even a bonus lick of licorice in the finish.',\n",
       " 'Lusty and rustic, this dry red blend has minty, peppery flavors of black cherries, briary berries and tobacco.',\n",
       " \"Light and supple, this pleasant effort is several cuts above the more generic Oregon bottling. Aged in French oak, 40% of it new, the pretty blackberry and black cherry fruit is washed with light, buttery toast. It's well-modulated and balanced.\",\n",
       " \"Always serviceably clean and dry, Handley's brut is a good everyday sparkler, forward in fruit and bright in cool-climate acidity, while a little rough in texture.\",\n",
       " 'A pretty nice Chardonnay at an affordable price. Dry and crisp, it shows pleasant flavors of pineapples, pears, peaches, vanilla and buttercream.',\n",
       " \"The youngest of Cristom's estate vineyards, Eileen is also at the highest elevation. Flavors follow: it is perhaps the most “Oregonian” of the lineup, with noticeable touches of tomato leaf and wet soil, along with tart blackberry and vanilla. Finishing tannins are quite dry and austere.\",\n",
       " 'A high-acid white, with grapefruit, pineapple and green apple fruit in the mix. This is snappy and tight, a great food wine, dappled with detailed hints of pepper, stone, citrus and finishing with orange marmalade.',\n",
       " \"Very dry and high in acidity, with a tart, almost sour mouthfeel, but that's good. It's like the refreshing, palate-stimulating quality of a sour red cherry candy. Additional richness comes from smoky, spicy oak. Represents a welcome return to form for this, Wild Horse's highest expression of Pinot Noir.\",\n",
       " 'This Chardonnay is so delicious in citrus, tropical fruit, peach and vanilla bean flavors, brightened with brisk acidity, that you hardly miss the absence of oak.',\n",
       " \"In only a few vintages, winemaker Regan Meador has created a splash in the New York wine scene and this Bordeaux-style red blend is a testament to the hype. A deft blend of Old and New-world styles, it contrasts silky, rich black cherry and currant flavors against deep layers of granite minerality, leafy herbs and potpourri florals. It's complex and yet so effortlessly brisk and spry. The finish is endlessly meandering.\",\n",
       " 'Rich, dense and oaky, a lovely Pinot Noir whose black and red cherry, black raspberry, currant, licorice, cola and spice flavors are wrapped into fine, sweet tannins. The estate vineyard lies on the cooler, western edge of Paso Robles, and benefits from a maritime influence.',\n",
       " 'Sweet and fairly simple, a Port-style blend of Cabernet Sauvignon and Syrah that features sugary blackberry and chocolate flavors.',\n",
       " \"This full-bodied wine smells ripe and buttery, like a pear tart, and has similar tasty flavors like ripe apple, vanilla and cream. Though it's not technically sweet, the personality is generous and the texture soft and rich.\",\n",
       " \"Here's a delicious Zinfandel to drink now. It's very rich in wild raspberry and cherry fruit, sweet tobacco, bacon and spice flavors, wrapped into thick but gentle tannins. Alcohol is high, but in balance.\",\n",
       " 'Made with Portuguese varieties, this dessert wine is sweet and simple. It has cherry compote, chocolate and sweetened coffee flavors, with a thick texture balanced with good, crisp acidity.',\n",
       " \"Tight, very dark, smoky and thick, this young wine will benefit from extended breathing time. At first it's quite bright, slightly volatile, explosive; with breathing time it fleshes out and brings in a rich rainbow of fruit, herb and earth flavors.\",\n",
       " \"Fire up the grill with beef, chicken and sausages to eat with this spicy, classic Paso Zinfandel. It's packed with sweetly ripe blackberry, blueberry and cherry fruit, cocoa and exotic spice flavors, wrapped into soft, dusty tannins.\",\n",
       " 'You have to classify this as a dry table wine, but it has enough residual sugar to qualify in the dessert category. With high, crisply clean acidity, it shows sugar-infused pineapple, pear, green apple and honeysuckle flavors.',\n",
       " \"Bella Vetta's 2005 was very good. This 2006 is easily on a par. It's a ripe, plush wine, filled with blackberry, currant and sweet oak flavors with a savory tease of leather that may be a touch of brett, but it acts as a spice. And look how modern techniques have tamed those fierce Howell Mountain tannins. The mouthfeel is sheer velvet.\",\n",
       " 'With its 90% Napa and 10% Sonoma lineage, this wine serves up mild lime, butterscotch and green apple aromas and a nicely weighted palate with tropical fruit, peach and caramel flavors. The mouthfeel is soft, with a caramel custard quality. The long, creamy and toasty finish will win raves from lovers of both the full malolactic and well-oaked styles.',\n",
       " \"Like the winery's other 2005 Chardonnays, this one, tasted in March, is tightly wound and minerally. The aroma will show little if the wine is too cold. Flavor-wise, hints of tart tangerines, lemongrass, green apples, candied ginger and vanilla cream swirl into a smoky oak, spicy finish. This is a Chardonnay that needs some time in the bottle. Drink now and for a couple of years.\",\n",
       " \"If you're looking for a nice summer rosé to accompany everything from fried chicken to fruit salad, look no further. This one's dryish to off-dry, with crisp acidity firming up raspberry, vanilla and cinnamon spice flavors.\",\n",
       " \"There's quite a bit of new French oak used in this blend, adding complexity in the form of buttered toast notes. But the wine is really all about fruit—massive flavors of limes, Meyer lemons, apricots, oranges, pineapples, peaches and honey. While that sounds like a laundry list, if you pay attention you'll find each strand of the tapestry. At the same time, it's bone dry and balanced with acidity. Don't drink it too cold.\",\n",
       " 'A bit minty, with some wintergreen notes, but otherwise rich in red and black cherry purée, anise, pepper and smoky oak. Finishes dry and spicy. Drink now.',\n",
       " \"There's a harsh edge of acidic, green sharpness to this wine. It's bone dry, with very modest blackberry fruit.\",\n",
       " 'Combines rich, vibrant acidity with fruity intensity in a very clean, opulent wine. Offers waves of tropical fruits, honeysuckle, buttered toast and minerals, with a long, spicy finish. The extensive new oak is perfectly in keeping with the size of this crowd-pleaser. Now–2014.',\n",
       " \"This pale-colored wine is light in texture, with a sheer, silk and satin, airy mouthfeel that reminds you of tea. It's also very acidic, and filled with youthfully immature fruit and spice. Brings to mind certain great Burgundies on release. It should be exciting to age this wine past 2008.\",\n",
       " 'Concentrated flavors of Kirschwasser, blackberry and raspberry. Intense and alcoholic, with some heat in the finish. Plump, round and full-bodied, with soft tannins and a hit of alcohol in the finish.',\n",
       " \"Although this Zin is fully dry, it's too soft in acidity, giving a flatness to the blackberry, cherry, licorice and spice flavors. Give it a bit more structure, and the score would soar.\",\n",
       " \"This is a wine that's been tremendously variable over the years, but with the '07, Craig has produced his best bottling since the late 1990s. Succeeds not only with dramatically ripe blackberry, currant, chocolate and sweet, smoky cedar flavors, but also with a structure of finely ground tannins and a long, dry, spicy finish. Drink now and for the next few years.\",\n",
       " \"Very oaky, with scads of toast, caramel and smoky vanilla, and the Cabernet Sauvignon fruit stars with its cassis flavors. This is a dark, rich wine, young in tannins, bone dry, and easily on a par with the wonderful '01. This bottling is raising the Cabernet bar in Paso Robles.\",\n",
       " \"Enormously rich in pineapple jam, crème brûlée, buttercream, toast and cinnamon spice flavors, this wine's richness is balanced with crisp, citrusy acidity. It offers direct appeal now.\",\n",
       " \"This is a good, rich bubbly, full-bodied and dry, with subtle flavors of red cherries, limes, vanilla and yeasty bread dough. It's a little scoury, but a good value for the money.\",\n",
       " 'Wonderfully frothy in the glass, this round, rich sparkling wine smells sweetly of apple cider and buttered toast. This Pinot Noir/Chard blend has plenty of toasty, nutty flavors on the palate as well. Fresh apple and lemon notes make this a refreshing, uncomplicated sip with a pleasant walnut skin astringency on the finish.',\n",
       " 'For the past several years, this Zin has suffered from the same flaw, excessive alcohol. Some wines get away with it. This one, with its raisiny, baked fruit taste, harsh tannins and hot mouthfeel, does not.',\n",
       " \"The former basketball star's initial release immediately establishes itself among the elite Cabernets of Napa Valley. Made from mountain vineyards on Atlas Peak and benches in the Rutherford appellation, it combines intensity with elegance. Bursts with upfront, delicious blackberry, crème de cassis and dark chocolate flavors that are wildly sweet on the midpalate, but then finish thoroughly dry. Structure comes by way of a tangy minerality and finely laced tannins. This is one of those wines that is softly decadent from start to finish, although it's probably not one to hold much beyond six years.\",\n",
       " \"Intensely ripe raspberry and cherry pie flavors mark this wine. Oak brings even greater richness, in the form of buttered cinnamon toast. The finish is dry, and there's a good burst of acidity. The alcohol is a little hot, but still, it's a nice, silky wine for drinking now.\",\n",
       " 'From a mix of Columbia Valley vineyards, the Bona Vita is mostly Malbec, with Cabernet Sauvignon, Cab Franc and Merlot contributing to the blend. Pretty strawberry fruit is somewhat overtaken by aggressively smoky barrel aging, or so it would seem. Charcoal and smoke components lend a slightly burnt edge to the tannins.',\n",
       " \"Fortified with a splash of brandy, this sweet Orange Muscat bears dense flavors of candied oranges and lemon slices. It's a rather thick, almost viscous dessert wine, with mouth-coating richness.\",\n",
       " 'Lovely lemon drop and tangerine fruit creates a juicy, vibrant mouthfeel, with a baby aspirin/orange candy streak running down the midpalate. Tasted just after being released, this looks likely to improve over the next year or two.',\n",
       " \"This Pinot Noir's raspberry and cherry fruit is joined by earthier notes of mushroom and mulch, plus a touch of spicy bacon. It's dry and full bodied, with a rich vein of acidity and a coating of furry tannins. Clearly a cellar candidate, this will benefit from 6–8 years of aging.\",\n",
       " 'Shows the difficulties of growing Sangiovese, even in posh Oakville. The wine is acidic and one-dimensional, with cherry jam, cola and oak flavors.',\n",
       " 'Normally used as a minor blending grape with Cabernet, Petit Verdot is difficult to make interesting by itself, and this one is no exception. Midnight black, raspingly dry and fiercely tannic, it has tobacco, cherry and oak flavors. Might someday evolve into something, but who knows.',\n",
       " \"Here's a nice, easy Rhône blend based on Grenache. Ready to drink now, it's dry and rich in red and black cherries, Dr. Pepper cola, bacon and sandalwood flavors, with smooth tannins.\",\n",
       " 'Hot and awkward, with jammy cherry, blackberry and chocolate flavors. High alcohol gives this wine an unbalanced, chili pepper burn.',\n",
       " \"So acidic it's sour, and the fruit flavors disappear in a tart swirl of wintergreen. Acceptable, but just barely.\",\n",
       " \"Cofermented with about 3% Viognier, this estate-grown Syrah is done in a style quite different from anywhere else on the West Coast. It's racy and almost delicate, with none of the jammy fruit of California or the funk of Washington. But what it does have is grace and detail—starting with plums and cherries and bringing in loads of spice and chocolate, hints of coffee grounds and a whiff of tobacco. It's all elegantly displayed, lingering and polished, with surprising length.\",\n",
       " \"The winery's most popular wine, Cali is 49% Cabernet Sauvignon, 47% Merlot and 4% Sangiovese. Nice aromatics lead into a medium-bodied wine with bright spices, strawberry preserves, some sour plum, and defining acidity, with a lick of chocolate in the finish.\",\n",
       " 'Unbalanced, with a hot, Porty mouthfeel and medicinal, sweet-and-sour cherry flavors.',\n",
       " 'An enticing Meritage, with aromas of violet, anise, crushed herbs and red berry fruit followed by deep, savory spice flavors of cinnamon, pepper and cedar. Balanced but full of character, this wine will pair well with meats and poultry dishes.',\n",
       " 'The Red Willow/David Lake style remains distinctly tight, firm and herbal. The softly herbal grace of the wine is quite pleasing if you let it be what it is, and the flavors spread out gently through the moderately long, finely detailed finish.',\n",
       " 'The 2008 Crannell leans to the herbaceous side of Oregon Pinot Noir, relatively low in listed alcohol (13%). Cranberry is the dominant fruit flavor, along with fresh herbs and whiffs of tomato leaf.',\n",
       " \"Ultrarich and forward in fruit, and what's wrong with that? Floods the palate with pie filling flavors of cherries and raspberries, with a rich coating of oak that adds vanilla, buttered toast and caramel. The richness is balanced with crisp acidity.\",\n",
       " 'A bit disappointing on the nose; pickle barrel and onion are supported by moderate spice. This is a dark, extracted wine with dusty tannins and a lean feel. Cherry/berry fruit flavors are shy as they compete with tomato, spice and onion before finishing metallic.',\n",
       " \"This is a rich, delicious Pinot Noir. It spreads a fantail of raspberry and cherry jam sweetness across the palate, and then the acidity kicks in, providing fortunate balance. With a silky texture, it's a lovely wine to drink now.\",\n",
       " 'An elegant blend from different estate vineyards, this widely available cuvée brings sturdy tannins and red currant fruit, highlighted with pretty baking spices. It would be an ideal match for roast duck with an orange sauce.',\n",
       " \"Bring this down to the cellar and let it sleep for at least 5–6 years. It's super-tannic, giving a hard, angular mouthfeel, even though the blackberry, cherry, currant and cedar flavors are powerful. It just wants to throw some sediment and let that mountain fruit shine.\",\n",
       " 'This new vintage of Consequence deftly mixes the strengths of each grape. The Sauv Blanc provides a pleasingly green, herbal base; the Aligoté fills in with some stone fruit flesh; and the Viognier boosts the aromatics, with floral/citrus highlights.',\n",
       " \"This has picked up softness and a honeyed mouthfeel, as the chemistry of aging on the lees does its magic. The wine has a plush, creamy feeling, with the silky smoothness of a great sparkling wine. Flavorwise, it's all pears, limes, dough and cinnamon spice. Delicious now, and should hold and improve over the next eight years.\",\n",
       " 'A lightly tawny straw color, this is scented with grass and hay and smoked meat—unusual for a Chardonnay. Light apple-flavored fruit carries that same, strong smoked meat (and slightly plastic) streak of flavor—unmissable and quite persistent.',\n",
       " \"From the orange, creamy buttermilk and earthy notes on the nose to the dry mineral, herb and Asian pear palate, there's much to savor here—such as the balance, proportion and long, citrus-mineral finish. This is a complex and reserved wine, not a conventional, in-your-face bottling. It's rather tight now, but if you give it two years (or more!), you'll be well rewarded.\",\n",
       " 'Takes all of the ingredients of Gristina\\'s estate Merlot and \"kicks them up a notch\"-cherry, plum, coffee and mocha aromas and flavors show good depth, a thick texture and a lingering finish. To be released 5/01.',\n",
       " 'Very ripe and forward in fruit, this Cabernet floods the mouth with cherry fruit flavors, liberally enhanced with the sweet vanilla and toast of oak barrel aging. The tannins are strong but finely ground. Appeals now for sheer beauty.',\n",
       " \"A lovely wine that makes the case for bottling Cab Franc on its own. Shows beautifully ripe, fine Napa tannins with complex flavors of red cherries, red currants, licorice, cola and cedar. Think of it as a Cabernet Sauvignon that's lighter in body and more elegant.\",\n",
       " \"This dramatic, compulsively good Cabernet is the first Howell Mountain Cab ever from the winery. It's enormous and gigantic in volume, with blackberry and cherry pie filling, cassis and oak flavors that scream, yet the tannins are tight, and the wine is so dry, the rich fruit is cloaked in a veil of control. Really defines an important new step for this veteran winery. Drink now–2020.\",\n",
       " 'Nice cherry fruit right up front brings some sweetness to this wine. Young as it is, the components are still knitting together, but there is much to enjoy already. Lovely grapey/cherry flavors are wrapped in light herb, and accented with almost salty sea flavors.',\n",
       " 'Smoky and a bit stark with whiffs of struck flint and stone. This off-dry Riesling is piercing on the palate with nervy lime-juice and lime-skin flavors. The finish is medium long, ending on a softly floral, crushed-stone note.',\n",
       " \"It's a Cabernet-Merlot blend from this highland appellation, inland from Anderson Valley in Mendocino County. The big drawback is excessive acidity. It's harsh and cutting, and interferes with what seem like pleasant blackberry, cherry and currant flavors.\",\n",
       " \"Lots to like in this Lake County wine. It's very crisp in acidity and clean, with a minerally scour to the lemon, lime and kiwi flavors. On the minus side, it's rather sweet, which gives it a fruit juice quality.\",\n",
       " \"Starts with a beautiful ruby color that's so pretty and gleaming. Appeals right away for its rich, attractive sour cherry candy, vanilla and anise aromas and flavors that are well-integrated with smoky oak. The tannins are firm, but ultra-refined, and the finish is entirely dry. A well-made, elegant wine of place that needs time. 2012–2018.\",\n",
       " 'A wonderfully drinkable sparkling wine that appeals immediately for its balanced texture and rich flavors. Easy to like for its array of raspberries, limes, vanilla, toast and yeast. The sour lees note is nicely balanced with the sweet liqueur of dosage.',\n",
       " 'Sangiovese is one of the hardest red wines to get right in California, but Frank Family gives it their best. The wine is dry, acidic and rewarding in cherry, tobacco, white pepper and sandalwood flavors. Pack in a little more complexity, and the score soars.',\n",
       " \"Lots of smoky leather and crushed black pepper in this wine, a clear sign the Syrah comes from a cool climate. Crisp acidity, too, giving the wine a bright mouthfeel. Might even have a drop of Viognier. There's a citrusy lift to the blackberries and black currants. Should develop smoothly through 2013.\",\n",
       " \"This wine hails from six Napa Valley vineyards, including the producer's Calistoga-based estate Bone Ash, as well as Beck stoffer Georges III in Rutherford. It opens in mouthfilling black licorice and blackberry, juicy and soft with the backbone to age. Dried herb provides a savory component, while a fresh vibrancy offsets the wine's denseness. Cellar this concentrated wine through 2022.\",\n",
       " 'Blueberry, black cherry and red berries on the nose are followed by structured but slightly tart red fruit flavors on the palate.  Diverse spices and some oak add weight and balance the edge. The wine is generally food friendly and flavorful.',\n",
       " \"The vineyard is on the cooler western edge of Paso Robles, and this bottling has been getting better over the years. The '07 is the best yet, a dry, crisp wine of richness and polish. Shows pineapple, nectarine and guava flavors, with a subtle minerality, creamy mouthfeel, and a fine coating of smoky oak.\",\n",
       " 'This is a big, ripe, rich Merlot, made in the modern style of fruity extraction. Cherries, red currants, red plums and vanilla-infused oak mingle together, leading to a spicy, dry finish. Now–2012.',\n",
       " 'This crisp and stylish Chardonnay could serve as a poster child for Washington, with its emphasis on the fruit, not the barrel, and modest ripeness that accents green apple and gooseberry flavors, with a little brioche in the finish. Scented with apple blossoms and lemon oil, this style brings out the intensity of the fruit, and enhances the capacity of the wine to cleanse your palate, leaving you refreshed and ready for food.',\n",
       " \"Like Colgin's great Herb Lamb Cabernet, this is 100% varietal, 100% new oak. It's a unique, different sort of Cab, opening with an iodine, Islay Scotch, sea-salt scent that turns surprisingly rich and fruity in the mouth, sweet in chocolate and extraordinarily ripe black currants. This very young wine needs time to show its best. Drink 2009–2015.\",\n",
       " 'This Central Coast vineyard has produced an extraordinarily rich, vibrant Viognier, brimming with tropical fruit, wildflower, honey and vanilla-spice flavors. It benefits from crisp acidity, and finishes clean and off-dry.',\n",
       " \"A couple of things about this wine are immediately striking: First is the fruit, which is enormously juicy to the point of jamminess, accented by smoky oak. Second is the smooth, supple texture, mainly due to the wonderful tannins. It's a complex, wholesomely dry wine, delicious now but with the structure to last at least a decade.\",\n",
       " \"They say the vines are 68 years old, and they certainly produced a dense, concentrated young Zin. It's like the liquid essence of raspberries, cherries and blackberries, enriched with a dusting of cinnamon, cocoa, coffee and nutmeg. The finish is completely dry. One problem: acidity is very low, making the wine soft and a little medicinal.\",\n",
       " \"An easy wine that shows Sauvignon Blanc's character in a zesty, slightly sweet way. The flavors are of pineapples, figs, lemongrass, honeysuckle and vanilla, heightened with crisp acidity.\",\n",

       " \"This is the winery's reserve cuvée, first produced in 1995 and released for the Millennium. It's half pinot and half chardonnay, made from the best of the best grapes and vintages. This is just the second release in the winery's two decade history. Though NV, it is based on the very ripe 1998 vintage. The winery's most elegant sparkling wine, it has a fine, textured mouthfeel and nicely nuanced flavors of pear, apple and light citrus. The over-the-top fruitiness of the regular brut is tamed, and it has the grace and texture of a genuine Champagne.\",\n",
       " 'Baked strawberry and a bittersweet note of cherry play off the palate around a medium-bodied frame of subtle tannin and oak. Dried cranberry comes in as a secondary detail, before the wine finishes in a blaze of leather and black tea.',\n",
       " \"Concannon has struggled to get Syrah right for many years, and this is actually their best release in a while. It's a dry, full-bodied, robust wine, rich in tannins and fruit, with some potential for development. The blackberry, coffee and spice flavors will play well against a nice steak.\",\n",
       " \"Showing the hard tannins and dryness of a young Petite Sirah, this is the kind of wine you normally would cellar. But there's a little streak of green unripeness that suggests aging will lead nowhere. So drink it now with big, lusty fare.\",\n",

       " 'An intricately layered nose of sagebrush, blood, pencil lead, soy, beef jerky, lilac, violet, lavender and tight cranberries shows on this stunning wine from the historic vineyard.

       " \"A very big, jammy Pinot Noir. Purists will object that it's too extracted, but it's awfully good and nicely silky in the mouth. Tastes like a liquid fruit bar, with cherry, raspberry, milk chocolate, roasted almond, honey-granola and caramel flavors.\",\n",
       " \"Although it's pretty tannic, with a furry quality throughout, this is pretty easy to drink. The flavors of blackberry jam, chocolate, bacon, black pepper and sandalwood are elaborate and rich. It might pick up some bottle complexity over the next 3–4 years.\",\n",
       " 'This is rich, ripe, fat and seemingly oaky. It may be too much of a good thing. Massive in caramelized, butterscotch, pineapple, peach, apricot, lime and cotton candy flavors, it might overpower any food you have it with. Almost better as a cocktail sipper.',\n",
       " 'The vintage was particularly successful for Patz & Hall, which achieved ripeness and balancing acidity with a seemingly effortless touch. This wine is brilliantly clean and extraordinarily rich in pineapples, Meyer lemons, sweet limes and minerals. Grows better as it warms in the glass.',\n",
       " 'Dark, robust and earthy, with  a pronounced smell and taste of caramel, this Tempranillo develops in lovely ways in the glass, so let it breathe. Its earthy character hints at dust, and the wine is soft, light and smooth. Enjoy with paella or grilled seafood.',\n",
       " 'Charry, smoky oak stars in this young, well-structured wine, leading to powerhouse peach pie (with the crust), lemon mousse and buttered toast flavors that finish long and spicy. Acidity is high, and gives a tangy minerality that adds complexity.',\n",
       " \"Kestrel remains one of the most enigmatic Washington wineries; brilliant at times, disappointing at others, possessed of excellent old-vine fruit and yet plagued with inconsistency. This Co-ferment Syrah was excellent in 2002 and even better in 2003, but falls a bit short in 2004. It's got the purple-black color but not the density to match; the fruit flavors are chewy and tart, and the wine has an acidic edge that leaves an impression of unripeness.\",\n",
       " 'Mostly Pinot Noir with some Chardonnay, this bubbly shows the pedigree of these two noble varieties in its balance and elegance. It has rich Champagne-like flavors of smoke, brioche, raspberry, lime and vanilla, and finishes dry and polished. This is a great price for a sparkling wine of this quality and sophistication.',\n",
       " 'Artesa takes a different approach to this difficult variety, blending it with Merlot, Malbec, Grenache and Grenache Noir. The result is more complex than the usual California Tempranillo, while retaining a silky, Pinot Noir-esque mouthfeel. Fully dry, the wine tastes a little baked in smoky pie-filling cherry flavor.',\n",
       " 'This blend of Zinfandel, Carignane, Petite Sirah and Mataro (Mourvèdre) is a good, rather rustic red wine. It has strong, jammy flavors of cherries, red currants, plumped raisins, peppery spices and sandalwood, and turns a little sweet on the finish.',\n",
       " 'This is a soft, lush, almost sweet Zinfandel. It has ripe, pie-filling flavors of raspberries and cherries, with a chocolate and spice finish. Feels a bit too soft, but the tannins are complex and refined. Drink now.',\n",
       " 'This is a very late release for this 2007 Merlot, and the wine is well on its way to full maturity. Smooth and supple, its fruit is drying out, showing cherry-flavored fruit leather as the main component. Streaks of coffee and tobacco fill in the finish.',\n",

The 2005 shows classic Napa structure, with hard but near-perfect tannins and lush, oak-sweetened black currant, cherry and dark chocolate flavors. Brilliant, but will benefit from a good three or four years in the cellar. Should evolve well beyond 2012.',\n",
       " \"This Chardonnay has ripe, rich tangerine, pear and pineapple flavors. It wasn't aged in oak, and the malolactic fermentation was blocked. The result is a clean, vibrant and mouthwatering selection.\",\n",
       " 'Made in a leaner, drier, lighter style than most Russian River Pinots, but the elegance and complexity are very attractive. Shows a white pepper and herbal note to the sour cherry candy fruit, and is balanced with perfect acidity. A beautiful wine to accompany, not overwhelm, fine foods. Production was an astounding 109,000 cases.',\n",
       " \"Dry, a bit raw, and dusty in tannins, this Zin offers up a blast of jammy blackberry, cherry and chocolate-covered mint flavors. It's a lusty wine that offers a great deal of everyday pleasure.\",\n",

       " \"This inviting wine smells sweet and jammy. It tastes spicy, lightly oaky and like ripe raspberries. Full bodied and high in alcohol, it's also smooth in texture, mouthfilling and rich. Flavors like chocolate and blackberry mark the finish.\",\n",

From the wild blackberry, raspberry, fig and tangerine zest fruit, to the clove, white pepper and anise spices, to the fabulously rich tannic structure, this is great, world-class Zinfandel. The high alcohol feels absolutely natural.\",\n",
       " \"Although it's the driest of Three Brothers' series of four Rieslings showcasing increasing sweetness levels, this wine would be more accurately described as off-dry in style. The nose is distinctly savory with hints of fennel, ramp and petroleum. On the palate, there's a surprising sunburst of lemon and lime balanced with a brisk acidity.\",\n",
       " \"Lots of blackberry, plum, currant and oak flavors in this classic Bordeaux blend. It's so ripe, it's almost sweet, except that the finish is thoroughly dry, with a stimulating scour of tannins and citrusy acids. Right now it's direct and not very complex, leading to the question of ageability. All indications are that it's not a wine you want to cellar, so drink up.\",\n",
       " \"While this Pinot isn't in the same league as the winery's 2011 Precious Mountain or Allen vineyard wines, it's a gorgeous wine nonetheless. With moderate alcohol and vibrant acidity, it offers complex layers of cherries, raspberries, cola, sandalwood and exotic spices. You won't be disappointed if you hold it until 2019.\",\n",
       " \"Soft in the mouth, with a somewhat simple structure, this Syrah's main virtue is flavor. It's enormously rich in ripe blackberry- and cherry-pie filling, cola, licorice, mint, chocolate, bacon and pepper flavors, and is fully dry.\",\n",
       " 'Appealing aromas of tobacco, smoke and spice herald the masculine edge to this red blend. Flavors of chocolate, smoke, spicebox and pepper are carried by a bright, red fruit wave. A touch tart on the finish but overall well rounded.',\n",
       " \"Some of the Napa '01s are instantly drinkable. Not this one. It's power-packed with tannins that numb the palate into submission. Hard to like now, and difficult to tell where it's going. Set it aside for a good six years and hope for the best.\",\n",
       " 'This easygoing, fruit-forward take on Pinot Gris is styled for immediate enjoyment. The fruit is ripe and flavorful—a nice mix of fresh cut pear and apple, with a hint of orange peel giving it a little stiffness and tannin. The blend includes Siegerrebe, Gewürztraminer and Viognier, and the alcohol is listed at just over 13%, so this is a perfect wine for a spring picnic.',\n",
       " \"This big, young Pinot should have been held back before release, because it's really tannic and primary now, making its future hard to evaluate. However, it seems a likely cellar candidate. It's fresh in acids and clearly has a pedigree of terroir, showing mineral-infused raspberries, cherries, rhubarbs, wild strawberries, and pomegranates, accented with rich, smoky oak. The texture is pure silk, and the finish is firmly dry. Give it until 2012, at the very least.\",\n",
       " \"Quite grassy and herbaceous, this is a Sauvignon Blanc for those who favor the tight, acidic-style of Loire valley versions. Citrus fruits and plenty of sharp acidity make this a wine to match with food, especially a nice goat cheese from the local farmers' market.\",\n",
       " 'This wine strikes a perfect balance, showing the jammy, slightly raisiny ripeness of Paso Robles fruit, but keeping enough acid in the mix to buoy it up. Plump and ripe, it gives a lot of flavor for the price, with interesting layers of fruit and earth through the finish.',\n",
       " \"Very sweet and high in acidity and tannins, this wine's forward black currant and chocolate flavors are easy to take, but the overall mouthfeel and structure are awkward.\",\n",
       " \"This is a very good blend from Paso Robles, showing the region's ability to ripen red grapes. It's a little on the soft side, but robust tannins provide good structure to the cherry, berry, beef jerky and pepper flavors. Drink now for freshness.\",\n",
       " 'A very rich Bordeaux blend based on Cabernet Sauvignon, but quite tannic. You want to give it some time in the cellar. Dry and full-bodied, it shows ripe, deep flavors of blackberry jam, black currants, dark chocolate and anise, with smoky overtones from oak. Feels dramatic and impressive. Give it until 2012 to come around.',\n",
       " 'Vanilla, black-cherry soda and a berry crème brûlée character combine for a very playful and fun nose on this bottling. The palate tightens up that fun a bit but stays sexy, offering dark chocolate, red-berry jam and a shred of mint.',\n",
       " \"This is cool-climate Pinot Noir, with the attendant herbal flavors that bring in forest floor, pine needle, tomato leaf and bark. It's spicy and sharp, focused and tannic, with a toasty finish from aging in 60% new French oak barrels.\",\n",
       " \"At more than three years of age, this Sangiovese is still fresh and vibrant in jammy cherry and black raspberry fruit. It's dry and brisk in acidity. It's a good wine, if a little simple, and will pair well with most beef dishes, especially prepared with mushrooms.\",\n",
       " \"Plummy, ripe, beginning to oxidize. Ready to drink right now, it's got a leafy, tomato flavor to it. Unusual.\",\n",
       " \"There's a fine coastal Pinot Noir in here, but right now it's buried under fresh, tart acids and astringent tannins. There's a rich heart of cherries, red currants, cola, bacon, pepper and smoky sandalwood, and the finish is rich and spicy. The wine wants two or three years to come around.\",\n",
       " \"Pinot maestro Longoria continues to try his hand at Bordeaux blends despite the uphill challenge. This '07 is a Cab Franc-based bottling. It's uneven, with cherry pie filling flavors, edgy tannins and unintegrated sweet, caramelized oak. There's even a bit of heat from high alcohol. Ready now.\",\n",
       " 'Light in body, and very dry and silky, this is an elegantly structured Pinot Noir. It shows modest, but clean, flavors of cherries, black raspberries, cocoa and vanilla. Drink now.',\n",
       " 'The fruit has a bit of the floral/soapy character of the grape, but lacks depth. It just floats away.',\n",
       " \"Has the feline scent, as well as zesty acidity, but if you can get past that, it's dry, and there's a wealth of ripe citrus and tropical fruits.\",\n",
       " \"There's a fine Pinot in here, but it's like buried treasure. Currently locked down with tannins, the wine shows extravagant flavors of dusty Asian spices, rhubarb, pomegranate, cola, cherryskin and sandalwood. Desperately needs time, but should be very fine. Drink 2011 through 2015.\",\n",
       " 'The vintage was a very good one for Calera, offering the heat needed for ripeness but the cool nights for acidity. Mills is a ripe, delicious wine with blackberry, cherry, cola, mint and spice flavors resting on a complex, multi-layered palate that finishes firm and dry. Supple now, it should drink well for ten years.',\n",
       " \"This single-vineyard 100% varietal bottling is too tough and astringent to drink now. It's in need of time to let the tannins dissolve and fall out. The question is whether or not the blackberry flavors are rich enough to survive. My guess is no.\",\n",
       " 'Often considered the iconic Cayuse wine, this bears the cartoonish label with the leering frog, though it is a single-vineyard offering like the others. Initially showing some fat and sweetness, it is supple and textural, with the density that comes from a mix of flavors: pain grillé, smoke, umami, fungus, coffee grounds and dark fruits. A richly organic compendium of scents and flavors, with black tea tannins.',\n",
       " \"This is made from declassified barrels originally intended for Stevens 424. It's sharp-edged and spicy, not yet wellintegrated, but substantial, with wild berry flavors and slightly green tannins. A good quaffer, or pair it with a flank steak.\",\n",
       " \"Shows a control and nobility that's rare in California Viogniers, and you have to attribute that to the vineyard, as well as Ehren Jordan's winemaking skill. Dry and deftly oaked, the wine has a brilliant balance of acidity and fruit, with creamy flavors of peaches, grilled pineapples, honeysuckle flowers and vanilla-cinnamon. Just stunning in its intensity, one of the finest Viogniers in the state.\",\n",
       " 'Trine, named for the three main partners at Pepper Bridge winery, is predominantly equal parts Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot, with a final 12% of the blend divvied up among the other three Bordeaux red grapes. It shows good balance and complexity, phenolic ripeness, texture and herbal detail. But despite so many good traits, it has less concentration than most wines in its price category.',\n",
       " \"The sweetness got out of hand in this wine, which tastes like it has excessive residual sugar. There's a raspberry and white chocolate power bar flavor. That's delicious, of course, but consumers should know the wine isn't dry.\",\n",
       " \"A bit rough and peppery , with a jagged mouthfeel. But it's nice and dry, containing proper flavors of blackberries, currants, herbs and cedar. Now through 2010.\",\n",
       " 'Enormously rich, like biting into a warm chocolate truffle with a cherry-blackberry core. Ultrasmooth, a bit soft and melted, but oh, so supple and velvety, with fine, firm tannins. Completely dry and balanced, this is a wine of harmonious complexity.',\n",
       " \"Strong in tangy, aggressive gooseberry flavors, this Sauvignon Blanc will appeal to fans of the simple New Zealand style. It's crisp in acidity, and turns sugary on the finish.\",\n",
       " \"The labels are hand-numbered; they are uniquely distinctive, with photos of ancient ruins that relate to historical events. This Merlot is sweet and pure and the oak shows through without obliterating the sweet fruit. It's a mélange of cherries, coffee and caramel; lush and round but spiced up and lifted with sweet acids. This exemplifies all that is delicious and profound about Washington Merlot.\",\n",
       " \"This Rhône-style blend of Syrah and Grenache is nice and dry, with a medium body that makes it feel just fine in the mouth. The acids and tannins are in balance. It's not especially concentrated, though, with peppery cherry flavors that finish quick.\",\n",
       " 'The fruit is forward and tart, mixing berries, cherries and plums; and the tannins almost disappear in a pillowy cloud. Up front this is a delicious wine, that seems to disappear in the middle and then return for a spicy flourish in the finish, marred a bit by a dominating chalkiness and a hint of dill.',\n",
       " \"This single-vineyard Syrah shows coffee, red cherry, red plum, pomegranate and white pepper flavors that are powerful, but subtle. It's drinkable now, with a tart, acidic streak through the finish that calls for rich grills and cheeses.\",\n",
       " \"The cow catcher is the front of the train engine guard, and speaks to the railroad theme of this winery. An outstanding “second” wine, this value blend drinks like a much pricier wine.

       " 'Perhaps because of the cold vintage, the wine is unsatsifyingly dry, tannic and acidic, showing only hints of sour cherry candy, cola and green mint tea. Not an ager, so drink up.',\n",
       " \"Lots of sweet cherry fruit in this polished red wine, which also shows the char and cedary flavors of oak barrel aging. It's gentle in tannins and has enough acidity for balance. A nice, everyday wine that brings to mind well-sauced pasta dishes.\",\n",
       " 'This is mostly Tempranillo, with Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot comprising the rest of the blend. The nose is liquorous and the wine dark and hot—to some tasters it may seem overripe. There seems to be some residual sugar also. Flavors are sweet black cherry and light prune, along with baking spice, hints of tobacco and licorice. Though 14.3% is the listed alcohol, it feels bigger and finishes with some heat and astringent tannins.',\n",
       " \"A fruity Pinot Noir, with delicious flavors of raspberry tart, Cocoa Puffs and vanilla cream. Feels a little too soft and melted for the cellar, but it's a sophisticated, dry wine that will pair nicely with steak.\",\n",
       " \"This might be called banana Port, for a rich, banana flavor is what dominates. Of course, with Muscat, you will also find tangerine and orange, like a tangy sauce over the richer, creamier banana. You've got to think—pair this with a banana split?

       " \"Young and thick in tannins, this Pinot will benefit from some time in the bottle. Although it's heavy now, it shows the classic aging elements of balance, dryness, and a rich core of cherries, red currants and cedar. Better after 2011.\",\n",
       " \"Five of the Bordeaux grapes were used in this wine, and two-thirds of the blend is Cabernet Sauvignon. Most of the grapes came from the excellent Canoe Ridge Estate Vineyard, and the rest were sourced from Cold Creek Vineyard.

       " 'The nose is lively and jumpy with notes of tart gooseberry, Granny Smith apple, lemony citrus and a hint of fresh ginger. The mouth offers riper, more oaky flavors of toasted nuts and pear flesh that lead through to the finish. Well balanced and easy to drink; so approachable, an excellent choice for outdoor summer dining with company.',\n",
       " \"Acidity marks this Chardonnay. It gives a tart, mouth-cleansing citrusy scour to the lemon and lime and pineapple flavors that finish so dry. It's a minimalist wine, with a minerally frame, and quite good with shellfish.\",\n",

       " \"Made in a fine, accessible style, this 100% Cab is delicious now with blackberry jam, chocolate and cassis flavors. It has classic Napa Valley tannins that are rich and ripe. This is a fancy wine, that's soft yet complex, and at this price, a good investment.\",\n",
       " 'The Shea is a bit of an anomaly at 13.7% in a vintage where the other Ken Wright Pinots float around the 12–12.5% mark. Not surprisingly, the fruit is thicker and the midpalate more full and broad, with pleasing cherry-berry flavors framed in chocolaty oak. Though not as aromatically complex as its companions, it offers plenty of rich fruit flavor.',\n",
       " \"This has pungent aromatics of petrol and grass, and the flavors follow. It's a reasonable style for the Sauvignon Blanc grape, but it likely will not appeal to all palates.\",\n",
       " 'Heavy and soft, with cherry and blackberry flavors that could almost be described as Rhône-style. Lacks delicacy and verve, but these mountain-grown wines can be deceptive in youth. Give it 5–6 years in the cellar, and try again.',\n",
       " 'A sound, pleasant Zinfandel with a good array of wild berry, cherry, anise, herb and white pepper flavors. The flavors are quite complex, but the wine is a little sharp and edgy in tannins, with some green notes.',\n",
       " \"This single-vineyard Pinot Noir is aged in almost entirely new French oak; otherwise it is indistinguishable from the winery's Cali's Cuvée bottling. If anything, Cali's has more density and earthy complexity, for less money.\",\n",
       " \"A welcome trend in Oregon is making Pinot Noir at moderate alcohol levels—here it's 13.5%. This enhances the wine's details, beginning with the aromas. Cola and clove, licorice and toffee scents promise a tasty bottle that turns out to be bursting with black berries, black cherries, black currant and even black tea flavors.\",\n",
       " \"Overripe, with apricot and pear flavors, although it's dry. The wine feels heavy and syrupy in the mouth, lacking vibrancy.\",\n",
       " \"A spicy but subtle nose of cigar spice and red berry lead into a spirited character of more spice and medium body on the palate. Though the wine has heft, it need more strength in the midpalate and has an overall tartness that could deter. Pair it with grilled meats, though, and you'll find it shapes up.\",\n",
       " 'A fine everyday Zinfandel, with a classic structure. Dry and velvety, it offers peppery flavors of blackberries and cherries, with earthier notes of tobacco and carob.',\n",
       " 'Well balanced and 100% varietal, this is a mix of berry, plum and cassis flavors that are annotated with notes of licorice, tar and coffee. Moderate in length and clean, this has polished tannins to keep it all in balance.',\n",
       " \"This soft, richly tannic red blend has complex layers of blackberries, cherries, plums, dark chocolate, peppery spices and smoky oak. It's a dry, balanced wine whose high alcohol gives it a warming feeling. Drink now.\",\n",
       " 'Shows the dryness, crisp acidity, flowers and minerality that often mark Carneros Chadonnays, which makes it elegant and sleek. With a touch of Meyer lemons and limes, it rises to richness.',\n",
       " \"Big and bold, this Chardonnay is made from fruit sourced from the winery's estate vineyard in the new Fort Ross-Seaview appellation. This underwent barrel fermentation, malolactic fermentation and lees aging, and the result is a rich selection that offers flavors of lemon and tropical fruit, buttered toast and cream. Almost too assertive now, it needs a year or two to resolve.\",\n",
       " 'A five-grape Bordeaux blend, substantial and pretty. Sweet, slightly candied cherry and plum fruit opens the wine, which has some interesting layering, bringing in cassis, hints of herb and edgy tannins.',\n",
       " 'Offers mild berry fruit allied to some green bell pepper and herb aromas.  A bit light and tart fo a single vineyrd wine, but still good.',\n",
       " \"Pricy, but flashy, a Cabernet to pour into your best crystal stemware. It's elaborate in blackberry, cassis and oak flavors, with a tug of minerals. Seems too soft to develop in the bottle, so drink now and through 2014.\",\n",
       " \"This late-disgorged wine has been released at the age of 11 years. It's a beautiful wine, notable especially for the ultrafine feeling of the mousse, or bubbles. So refined and silky. Rich too are the flavors, in limes, strawberries, toasty lees and minerals. A spectacular sparkling wine that has many years of development ahead.\",\n",
       " \"If only this blend of seven popular varieties were drier, it would score higher. It's crisp in acidity and complex in orange, peach, pear, honeysuckle, vanilla and mineral flavors. But the sugary finish puts it into the fruit juice category.\",\n",
       " \"Compared to the winery's Starr Ridge Chard from the same vintage, this is unassertive. It's thicker in the mouth, and softer, with a malted, custard texture framing peach flavors.\",\n",

       " 'Sweet and candied, with raspberry and cherry pie, vanilla, dusty chocolate truffle and cinnamon spice flavors. A bit hot, too, with high alcohol that burns in the finish. Drink now.',\n",
       " 'What we have here is really a Cabernet-based blend, or a Meritage-style blend if you wish. It shows good structure, a stiff spine, some barrelly chocolate and caramel flavors, and a slight burst of heat in the finish.',\n",
       " 'Overripe and pruny-raisiny, like a cheap Port but without any sweetness, just acids and raw tannins.',\n",
       " \"This is a small-production blend of Cabernet Sauvignon and Cabernet Franc made by a winemaker who knows a lot about Bordeaux blends, Genevieve Janssens, the longtime vintner at Robert Mondavi. It's ripe and pretty tannic, with cassis and smoky, 100% new oak flavors. An ambitious wine, it's quite good, and needs time in the cellar to soften and resolve. Best after 2008, at least.\",\n",
       " \"There's a lot of slate minerality on the nose of this bottling, alongside bright and fresh boysenberry fruit and a pine-needle character. The palate is tart with plum skin and grippy tannins, well balanced and also showing just the right amount of barnyard funk.\",\n",
       " 'Fruity-sweet and very full-bodied, with powerful, jammy cherry and spice flavors, edged with baked brown sugar. A little too brawny, even for Zin.',\n",

       " \"Notes of sweet, juicy honey tangerines, stone fruit and muskmelon show on this powerfully fruity, off-dry Gewürztraminer. It's juicy and forward, but brisk orange-rind notes and citrusy acidity adds balance and structure.\",\n",
       " 'Tightly wound, dry and acidic, this Pinot Noir offers direct and jammy flavors of cherry and persimmon. The structure is fine, with firm tannins and stony minerality. Once decanted, it can be consumed now, or it can be cellared for 3–5 years.',\n",
       " 'Simple and very dry, with herb-infused pineapple flavors and unnatural acidity.',\n",
       " \"The winery must have held this back this long to let the acidity soften, but it's still a crisp Chardonnay. A big one, too, packed with tropical fruit, roasted coconut, creamy lees, steely mineral and new oak flavors. Give it until 2007 to resolve itself.\",\n",
       " \"Pure Merlot, from the Red Mountain vineyard, this displays that AVA's stiff, hard-edged tannins, keeping the fruit pinned down into a compact core. Cassis and black cherry, iron filings and some tar are all carefully balanced. There's plenty of muscle for further aging, and a hint of heat in the finish.\",\n",
       " 'Old vine (1967 planting) Sauvignon Blanc from Oregon? OK, this is a rarity. The wine has a gentle grace, and manages to convey layering and complexity within a fairly light frame. Moderate acidity, some yeasty texture, and a mix of apple and citrus fruit all come together in a clean, fresh, well-balanced effort.',\n",
       " \"The '03 was so good, but the '04 is a big step down, and you have to blame it on the vintage. Week after week of unrelenting September heat caused problems statewide, and you can taste a hot, stewed-fruit quality in this otherwise fine wine.\",\n",
       " 'This Pinot Noir is so rich in fruit and oak, it tastes like a melted dessert tart. Wows with raspberry and cherry jam, vanilla bean, bacon, buttered cinnamon toast and smoky wood flavors, wrapped into a light, airy texture. Drink it now with a terrific steak.',\n",
       " 'A softly tannic and dry Zin. Offers wild berry, cherry, currant and spice flavors, with a meaty edge, like beef teriyaki. Easy to drink with a perfectly grilled steak.',\n",
       " \"The oak really stands out, so if you're sensitive to that, avoid. But others, including this reviewer, will find the toasty vanilla, meringue, butterscotch and char flavors perfectly in keeping with the ripe tropical fruit, pear and Meyer lemon flavors.\",\n",
       " 'From the oldest vineyard on Long Island comes this well-oaked wine. Fruit is missing from the bouquet, which has mint and spice but also nail polish and horsey notes. The flavors are on the weedy side, with tomato and sweet oak trying to cover. Still an okay wine, light-bodied and smooth, with high acidity. But definitely less ripe than better vintages.',\n",
       " 'Waxy apple stars in this brisk, approachable white from a single estate-farmed block, the oak briny and salty in toast and honey. Textured and elegantly light bodied, it finishes with a satisfying note of lemon candy.',\n",
       " 'Aromas of red berries with thyme and anise accents also show a whiff of acetone that bothered some tasters. After that, this wine is on very comfortable ground. Smooth and evenly textured, it has a balanced, even graceful quality often lacking in Zinfandels. Good length and mild pepper and spice mark the finish.',\n",
       " 'Earth, mud and wet clay are laid against a ripe black raspberry frame on this bottling from winemaker Larry Brooks. Plenty of life, zest and lift enliven the beautifully spiced palate, with bright red cherries, cranberries and purple flowers cut by a line of pencil-lead minerality and a savory fennel element.',\n",
       " \"Equal parts Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot finished off with 5% Cabernet Franc, this cool-vintage wine is light in color. Notes of plum and cranberries come with herb and floral accents. It's light and lively with elegant, pretty fruit flavors backed by mouthwatering acidity with a lingering finish.\",\n",
       " 'Ripe, soft and polished, this is one of those Cabernets that feels fancy and upscale in the mouth. Mainly that comes from the quality of the tannins, which are refined and sweet, and the flavors, which are a combination of blackberry, ripe grapes and new oak. Probably at its best now and for the next five years.',\n",
       " 'Well-aged and drinking at a peak, this 100% Sangiovese is round and toasty, filled with plush cherry fruit, and just a smidgen of green olive. The barrel aging brings in accents of toasted walnuts through a full, inviting finish.',\n",
       " 'Raw and common, with excessively sweet, jammy cherry-berry flavors and a bizarre streak of acidity that tastes like it came from a box.',\n",
       " 'Minty, green aroma. Herbal, with oak and modest blackberries. Well-made, elegant, but thin. Drink now.',\n",
       " 'Very dry, but soft in acidity, this variety is also known as Mourvèdre. The wine is gentle and easy, with milk chocolate, black cherry, red currant, licorice and pepper flavors. Drink now.',\n",
       " 'Can Syrah get any richer than this wine? It has massive flavors of chocolate, licorice, blackberry pie, brown sugar, exotic spice and sandalwood that taste sweet yet finish dry and smooth. The tannins are so thick, you will need steak or lamb to wrestle them to the ground. Drink now–2016.',\n",
       " \"From a cool area of the valley comes this very dry, astringently tannic wine, which is not very fruity. The flavors are lean, veering toward dried herbs, leather and earth, with a cherry core. The texture is rich and complicated. It's a young wine and if you're a risk-taker, you should lay it down.\",\n",
       " \"The Savoya Pinot Noir displays excellent concentration and grip and its raspberry/cherry fruit gives it a tart, racy flair. There's an herbal edge to the tannins, but overall this is very well crafted, balanced and built for medium-term cellaring.\",\n",
       " 'This new Malbec is a soft, fruity, extremely dark wine, with scents of raisins and pretty fruit flavors of boysenberries and black cherries, with lighter streaks of coffee and caramel woven through. The balance is excellent, though the wine does not show the depth of flavor that is expressed in its inky dark colors.',\n",
       " \"Made with fully ripened grapes, this is a lush, complex, thoroughly enjoyable wine. It's fairly dry by California standards, but offers up masses of sweet fruit and oak extract. The balance is especially nice; all parts are in harmony. Editors' Choice.\",\n",
       " \"Showing Talley's distinctive elegance and brilliant structure, this Chard is a blend of the Rincon and Rosemary's vineyards. The wine's architecture really makes it special, with acidity and dusty tannins providing the bare bones to the lemon, lime, pineapple and mango fruit. A great wine to have with food.\",\n",
       " \"The 2009 DTR Syrah won't be available until 2013 and is appropriately still tight, waiting to resolve itself into the superbly structured, bone-dry, savory wine it will become. There's a lot of minerality lurking between walls of black fruit and white pepper spice.\",\n",
       " 'Oak gives this wine a caramel-like richness, while the underlying fruit is jammy and spicy in cherries and raspberries. The result is a somewhat candied Zin. Drink it now.',\n",
       " 'This sugary-sweet, frizzante-style sparkler is the sort of wine your grandmother might enjoy. It tastes like orange soda, only with 11% alcohol for a little extra kick in the back of the throat.',\n",
       " \"Amazingly rich, one of the most opulent Chardonnays you can drink now. Just wows the mouth with pineapple, pear, exotic tropical fruit, crème brûlée, vanilla custard, buttered toast and cinnamon spice flavors that go on and on through the finish. Also shows fine, tart acidity, which provides needed balance. Yes, it's superripe, but this is what California Chardonnay does at its best.\",\n",
       " 'A little too ripe and oaky for elegance, this is almost dessert-like, in the sweet vanilla, crème brûlée and pineapple jam flavors. Crisp acidity helps to balance.',\n",
       " 'A beautiful Cabernet that gives a nod to Bordeaux in its earthy dryness and moderate alcohol. There are plenty of blackberries, cherries and currants, but also notes of violets, mushrooms and herbs that make it complex. Fresh acidity and thick tannins provide structure to this wine, which comes from the cooler districts of Oakville and Coombsville. Now–2014.',\n",
       " \"Very sweet, with flavors of honey, apricot jam, orange essence and smoky vanilla. There's lots of good acidity to make it clean. Could be more concentrated, though.\",\n",
       " \"The 2005 vintage was a very great one for Iron Horse. This 100% Chardonnay reflects the perfect growing conditions. It's dry and especially elegant, with rich brioche, lime and green apple flavors, and a firm minerality in the finish. Drink now.\",\n",
       " 'This opens with lots of spice, tart and light red fruits and some strongly herbal tannins. There is a big wash of sweet baking spice, source unknown, that offsets the stemmy and herbal quality of the fruit.',\n",
       " 'Pretty good price for an everyday Cabernet-based wine with some nice fruity flavors. Shows blackberries, black cherries and black currants, and is dry and spicy.',\n",
       " \"Owner Kenny Kahn reserves the “Best Barrel” designation for his best wine. This year it's a Malbec. Pours inky black, and explodes with blackberry pie filling, chocolate, plum sauce, licorice and cedar aromas. Drinks as powerfully rich as it smells, offering immense flavors and luxuriously smooth, velvety tannins. Very soft. Drink now through 2009 before the fruit fades.\",\n",
       " 'Has all your basic barrel-fermented Chardonnay character without being particularly complex. The wine is slightly sweet and oaky-creamy, with apricot, pineapple, peach and spicy mango flavors.',\n",

It's just beginning to pick up aged notes, making it sweeter and more mellow than it would have been two or three years ago. Kudos to Balletto for holding it back before  release. Drink now–2016.\",\n",
       " 'Hot and peppery, with simple flavors of baked fruits and oak.',\n",
       " \"This wine has a flinty, minerally personality, with a full  overlay of toasty oak. Don't look for fat, blockbuster fruit here—the flavors tend toward lime and tangerine. The oak adds caramel, vanilla and smoky notes. It's supple in the mouth but closes strangely flat.\",\n",
       " \"Lots of acidity and dryness in this Chardonnay. It will strike some as austere and lean. But it's fascinating in its citrus fruits and minerals, which seem to come from the stones of the Arroyo Seco. Oak influence adds much-needed notes of buttered toast. Gets better and better as it warms in the glass.\",\n",
       " \"Forward, tart and spicy, the Canary Hill's tangy red fruit is lifted with light citrus—lime and grapefruit. Nicely balanced and moderate in length.\",\n",
       " \"This is a blend of several vineyards from throughout the sprawling Sonoma Coast region. It shows crisp, upfront acidity that makes the wine tart, and lasts through the dry finish. Flavor-wise, it's all about pears, enriched with toasty oak.\",\n",
       " \"The Cowgirl Cab, a blend of Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot, is DaMa's most popular offering. Loaded with bright, brambly berry fruits, licorice and loam, it's notable also for smooth, silky tannins.\",\n",
       " 'A selection of estate, Tualatin and Elton vineyard fruit, this carries the style of those wines to a more refined, high-toned level. The fruit is a bit more complex, and highlighted with baking spice, incense and toasted nuts. Just under 14% alcohol, it retains the essential character of the elegant Pinot Noir grape, but pushes it to a point where some heat comes into the finish.',\n",
       " \"This is a gorgeous wine that's fat and smooth in nectarines, tangerine, custard and tropical fruits, with a kiss of sweet, smoky oak. The two varieties were co-fermented in this very happy marriage of a wine.\",\n",
       " \"Here's a nice Pinot Noir that shows cool, coastal influence in the crispness and overall balance. It's not a big, rich wine, but quite elegant, with suggestions of cherries, herbs and sandalwood. Ready now.\",\n",
       " \"Some producer in Carneros didn't want the wine that went into this negociant's ‘07 Syrah, to judge by its quality. Lucky for Cameron Hughes. It's a fine wine, full-bodied and dry, with spicy flavors of currants, teriaki beef, black pepper and cola, with a bracing minerality that grounds the richness. Could be more concentrated, but it's a very great value.\",\n",
       " \"Nearly 100% Cabernet Sauvignon, this firm young wine showcases Napa Cab at its best. It's powerful in cassis and mocha flavors, with complex spice notes. The considerable new oak fits in fine given the wine's size. Extraordinarily smooth and lush, it's beautiful now, but has the  structure to age for a decade. What a beauty.\",\n",

       " \"Garnet long has been one of California's greatest entry-level Pinot Noirs, and it still is. Maybe the best. The '09 reflects the balanced vintage. It's a dry, silky, light-bodied wine, with pretty raspberry and cola flavors.\",\n",

The fruit is very much on the light side, and can't begin to stand up to all the toast and butterscotch that is being tossed around. It's not bad, but it has not yet found its balance, and finishes with some lightly stemmy tannins.\",\n",
       " \"A deliciously priced blend of 60% Mourvèdre, 13% Syrah and 27% Grenache that'll be tricky to ask for by name but is worth the effort to find and share. This blend shows off brooding dark dollops of spicy fruit, herb and tobacco that are tenaciously balanced by the cherry tones from the Grenache. A fun wine to pass around at parties and barbecues.\",\n",

       " 'Fruity and soft, a cloying wine with medicinal cherry flavors.',\n",
       " 'An extremely tannic and tough wine that numbs the palate despite polished plum, blackberry and dry chocolate flavors. Oak adds vanilla, smoke and a richly creamy texture. Will it age? The compact berry-cherry flavors suggest yes. Try again in 10 years.',\n",

The York Mountain AVA is in a cooler, hilly part of western Paso Robles, wide open to Pacific influence, and you can taste the salty sea breeze in the crisp acidity and fine tannins, not to mention the white pepper flavors that give a piquant spiciness to the blackberries and mocha. Drink this fine young Syrah now, or hold for up to six years.\",\n",
       " \"Past vintages of Barrel Thief have been red blends, but in 2004 it's labeled Cabernet Sauvignon. The rest of the blend is Cab Franc and Merlot, so the Thief has gone a bit upscale, with visions of Bordeaux dancing in its head. Screwcapped and high-toned, there's nothing shy about this wine. It hits you head-on, dumps its plain fruit flavors and runs off, leaving a bit of volatile heat in the back of your mouth.\",\n",
       " \"This is a tough wine in two ways. It's rather hard and brittle in acids and tannins now, and it's also tough to predict its future. It's rich in currant, blackberry jam, coffee and cedar flavors, but there is an undertow of raisins that could compromise its longterm viability.\",\n",
       " 'Fabulous aromatics on this blend of Syrah, Grenache and Mourvèdre. About one-third inclusion of the stems during fermentation gives it a spiciness, and also some grippy tannins. Underneath are bright red and black stone fruits and berries. Very exotic and compelling.',\n",
       " \"The winery calls this their Artist Series signature line. It's an unusual blend of Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, Syrah and Pinot Noir. The red grapes meld together into a strawberry/raspberry compote, with licorice and tobacco highlights. It's spicy and sharp, with a candied, red licorice finish, and some chalky acids.\",\n",
       " 'The wine begins to change immediately; as soon as the cork is pulled the bouquet emerges and begins to evolve. Thin layers of scent and flavor are stacked, with rose petals on top, then supremely dense with darker layers of smoke, graphite, ash, mushroom, black fruits. The tannins never stick out and the flavors just keep on going, bringing in cured meats, mocha, and on and on.',\n",
       " \"This is so delicious and classic, it's totally enjoyable now, but it has the structural balance to age for quite a while.

Has the balance and depth of a fine Cabernet Sauvignon, but with Zin's spicy, briary, brambly personality. Erupts in wild berry, currant, cola, leather, mocha and peppery spice flavors that are so rich and deep and long-lasting. Pricey, but sets a benchmark for Zinfandel. Only 550 cases were produced.\",\n",

       " \"A Bordeaux blend based on Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot, the grapes for this stunning wine came from David Abreu's vineyard in the St. Helena foothills. It's very complex, softer, more open and approachable than Colgin's 100% Cabs, with a flamboyant spectrum of cherries,  framboise, cocoa, violets, gingerbread and spices framed in supple, fine tannins. Beautiful, a feminine wine of great beauty. Drink now through 2015.\",\n",
       " \"Shows Viognier's fruity, exotic side, with flavors of papaya, guava, nectarine, and good old green apples, along with scads of spices and honey. Lots of acidity provides needed brightness and zest. This is a good, rich Viognier for sole in a spicy cream sauce.\",\n",
       " 'A very rich and intricate Pinot Noir, full-bodied and fairly tannic, yet with a delicately silky texture. Shows fully-ripened fruit flavors of cherries and raspberries, with spice and oak complexities. Good now, but could blossom after 2012–2013.',\n",

       " 'For a reserve, this seems surprisingly light, attenuated and acidic. The cranberry/strawberry fruit, of modest weight and depth, offers barely a hint of the 100% new French oak—just a faint flavor of hazelnuts and milk chocolate.',\n",
       " \"The Creator is a blend of 60% Cailloux Cabernet Sauvignon, and 40% Morrison Lane Syrah. It's a fascinating mix, with powerful fruit from two iconic Walla Walla vineyards. Neither dominates; the Cailloux Cab is somewhat muted by the Morrison Lane Syrah, which in turn is muted by the Cailloux. The result is a blend that expresses rather than shouts the attributes of each, while remaining balanced and complete.\",\n",

Closes handsomely, with full even tannins and some white pepper on the long back end. Drinks well now and has the structure to last and improve for a few years as well.',\n",
       " 'A big wine, deep and dense, scented with violets, toast and vanilla.

The blackberries, black cherries, licorice, and raspberries have elements of roasted meats and wild mushrooms sautéed in butter, tamari and a few drops of balsamic, liberally dusted with black pepper. Unique and compelling, and should develop over the next six years.\",\n",

It's so dry, balanced and complex, yet so tannicly tough now, that it demands a good 6 years, at a minimum. The heart of blackberries and red currants is opulently rich, with overtones of cedar, pencil lead, red licorice and sweet dried herbs. Brings to mind a classic Rutherford Cab. As delicious as the wine is now, especially with decanting, it really will benefit from aging.\",\n",
       " \"Tart and minerally, this high-acid Chard has green apple pie flavors, sprinkled with cinnamon and nutmeg. It's bone dry, an angular, somewhat lean wine that needs food to show what it can do. Try with grilled salmon.\",\n",

       " \"Lush and immediately attractive, this Pinot seduces the palate with ripe berry, cola, herb tea, vanilla and spice flavors and lots of toasty oak. It's a silky wine, with a fancy structure that calls for fine food. But it's also young, with a precocious feeling. Try holding until 2010, and it should develop through 2015.\",\n",
       " 'Smells like graphite and rich, dark fruit—very promising. Soft, plush and plummy on the palate, just comes up a bit short on the finish.',\n",

A great accomplishment, with nearly 13,000 cases produced.',\n",
       " 'Pure Roussanne; plump and spicy, with beguiling accents of cinnamon around rich fruit. Orange, tangerine and apricot fruits are in full display, the wine is round and luscious and the finish quite full and satisfying.',\n",

In Washington's Wahluke Slope, Zin ripens well without turning into a Port-like substance. Tightly-defined raspberry, blackberry and plum fruits, scented with violets and juicy with fresh acid, take to the new oak aging well. It's a balanced mix of berry, barrel and crisp, palate-cleansing acid.\",\n",
       " \"Tasted in October, 2007, the wine was mute, offering little aromatically except for teasing notes of blackberries and oak. That shyness extended to the taste, where strong, hard tannins provide an almost impenetrable coat of armor to what's inside. But right down the middle of the palate is a deep, intensely powerful stream of perfectly ripened cassis that's all the proof you need of ageability.

       " \"Though not as ripe or potent as the leading Boushey Vineyard Syrahs, this delicate wine is nicely balanced and reasonably complex, showing light pepper along with tart cherry- and berry-flavored fruit. There's plenty of acid, but the fruit is ripe enough to avoid the sour-candy label.\",\n",
       " 'Swanky is a good word to describe this bone-dry, acidic blend of Viognier, Chenin Blanc, Muscat and Sauvignon Blanc. Something about it reminds you of a martini.

A fragrant peach, pineapple, smoke and floral bouquet might, in other wines, be overpowering, but here it is subtly seductive.

There are layers of nuance to explore here—savor this one slowly.\",\n",
       " \"Although it is not entirely laced together, this substantial wine makes a good impression with its ripe purple fruits and strong vanilla and coffee and coconut barrel notes.

Screwcap.\",\n",
       " \"This wine is oaky; it's 100% barrel fermented and aged in new French oak for 12 months. Despite that, it's not over the top. Aromas of smoke and cured meats lead the way, then sweet pears.

       " \"Clean and refreshing with an abundance of sweet Meyer lemon and pommelo notes on the nose and palate, this is another great example of Finger Lakes Pinot Gris. Medium-bodied with a luscious, mouth-quenching quality, it's carried from start to finish by a lingering white floral note and pleasant grapefruit pith astringency.\",\n",
       " \"A good, rugged but deeply flavorful wine, at a decent price. It's very dry and full-bodied, with a tannin-acid balance that suggests barbecue. The finish is filled with blackberries and crushed black peppercorn.\",\n",
       " \"This wine has flavors of cherries, berries, currants and herbs; it's hard in tannins and very dry. With this rugged mouthfeel, it doesn't seem worth the price.\",\n",
       " \"Just one barrel was made of this complex, nicely sculpted, 100% Malbec. It's from fourth leaf fruit, showing bright and fresh raspberry flavors, compact herbs, and streaks of tar and earth. A floral note (clover?) comes in as the wine breathes open. Still young and slightly reduced, it will reward decanting.\",\n",
       " 'This country-style wine has bright citrus-accented fruit and buttery spice aromas, and drinks pleasant and dry. On the finish, it turns citrusy again.',\n",
       " \"Here's a lovely, dry Napa Cab, less flashy and more tannic than some others, but perhaps more balanced and ageworthy. It has equal shares of blackberry and cherry fruit, with earthy, tobacco and coffee notes. New, sweet oak imparts extra richness. Should improve for the next six years or so.\",\n",
       " \"The newest Ursa is 50% Merlot, 24% Cab Franc, 17% Cabernet Sauvignon, 7% Malbec and 2% Petit Verdot, and it is absolutely delicious right out of the chute; no breathing needed. It's got plump and sweetly juicy cherry and berry fruit flavors, mixed in with cherry candy, red licorice, anise and spice. Good persistence and length.\",\n",
       " 'Among all the new releases from Betz Family, the La Serenne is the least approachable. Almost enigmatic in its reluctance to open, the wine remains stubbornly tight after a full 24 hours of breathing. The nose shows the barrel influences in a range of toast, coffee and mocha scents. Flavors bring black cherry, cassis, hints of black olive and a little brown sugar, but overall the wine seems shortened, almost dumb. At this point, the score is a best guess, and could go even higher as the wine ages.',\n",
       " \"Gary Eberle's Paso Robles Cabernet has been consistent over many years, and his '06 bottling shows off his understanding. It's a soft, pleasant wine that offers waves of blackberry jam, black currant, cocoa and cedar flavors, with an elegantly drinkable mouthfeel. Nice with barbecued steak and garlic-rosemary roasted new potatoes.\",\n",
       " 'Quite a beautiful, lush Syrah, and one that goes a long way to restoring faith in this long under-performing appellation. Dry and soft, the wine offers rich flavors of cassis, melted dark chocolate, leather, vanilla and anisette, with a pleasantly spicy edge of black pepper. Drink now.',\n",
       " 'A good effort in a challenging vintage. This has a warm core of round, pretty cherry fruit, with a dash of bitters, sassafras and caramel. It persists through the middle into a Dr. Pepper finish, with details of herb and earth.',\n",
       " \"Tannic and heavy now, a shut-down Pinot that's so full-bodied, it tastes like Grenache. Shows a multitude of red cherry jam, root beer and anise flavors, with herbs and earthy mushrooms. Should age. Better after 2011.\",\n",
       " \"This is Stephen Ross's best Bien Nacido Pinot in recent years, showing a great marriage of power and refinement. The wine shows primary fruit, dusty spices and acids. It's a little dry and angular, but will reward some cellaring. So complex, yet you can drink it now, but decant first.\",\n",
       " 'This is soft and leathery, with herb and fennel and tobacco notes, and in a blind tasting it might pass for Italian. The extra bottle age has smoothed out the tannins, keeping the smoky tar and licorice, along with some tack room scents and a streak of leathery flavor. Right now this is drinking really well.',\n",
       " \"Here's an intense, nervy young Cab that impresses for its powerful oak and cassis flavors. It's a little sharp now, with an acidic jamminess and tea-like tannic structure that suggests moderate aging capability. Stash it until 2008, then open for a couple of years.\",\n",
       " \"Good acidity in this wine, with a pleasant minerality, but it's really too fruity and buttery. Shows little subtlety beyond pineapple, peach and pear jam flavors.\",\n",
       " \"The vineyard has had a long, checkered history, and Byron has dipped into it for many years for Pinot Noir that's almost always compelling. Their ‘06 is a dark, full-bodied wine. It's dense in young, jammy black cherry and mocha fruit and very spicy. Feels dramatically rich and complex, and should develop bottle nuance over the next six years.\",\n",
       " 'A glorious success, for this or any vintage. It shows classic Russian River balance and refinement, with exquisitely ripe berry and stone fruit flavors counterbalanced with earthier mushroom and funky leather notes. The acids, tannins and silky mouthfeel are textbook Pinot. Best now–2012.',\n",
       " \"Made from 75% Syrah and 25% Grenache, this blush wine shows cool-climate acidity and a fine minerality that make it racy and clean. There also are long hangtime hints of raspberries and strawberries. It's a fine rosé to drink with bouillabaisse. From Francis Ford Coppola.\",\n",
       " \"The tannins are strong in this 100% Cab, giving it a tough astringency, but there's no denying the wealth of blackberries, black currants, violets and cedar that flood the mouth and last through a long, spicy finish. The vineyard is in the cooler southern part of the valley, on the east side of Oak Knoll. Give this wine time. 2012–2018.\",\n",
       " 'Very ripe, rich and fruity, showing powerful blackberry, cassis and cedar flavors. The structure is classic Napa, with firm, dynamic tannins and a fine application of acidity. Feels just great in the mouth, if on the young side. Give this wine three or four years in the cellar.',\n",
       " 'Under the warm Lodi sun Cabernet gets as ripe as anywhere in California. The trick is balance, which Peirano dependably achieves. This wine is robust in blackberry jam, cassis and chocolate flavors, but has good acids and firm tannins, and a soft, voluptuous texture.',\n",
       " 'A bit of a muted nose on this blend of Cabernet Sauvignon (42%), Merlot (24%), Petit Verdot (22%), Cab Franc (11%) and Malbec (1%) out of the Livermore Valley. A good balance of fruit and tannic power here, but not a ton of depth. The finish drops off a bit, too.',\n",
       " \"So fruity it's almost sweet. Made in the popular style, it's candied in vanilla, pineapple, buttered toast and caramel flavors.\",\n",
       " \"This is a fresh, vibrant stainless steel-fermented Chard that boasts charming notes of fresh apple slices, nectarine, lemon rind citrus and a hint of yellow florals. It's ripe and big without being too spicy or overdone, with a solid, lengthy finish. Drink now.\",\n",
       " 'Clean and easy drinking, this is created using a fruit from all three estate vineyards. Lightly spicy apple, pear and peach flavors combine gracefully, giving the wine a solid and appealingly fruity core.',\n",
       " 'Scents and tastes of beeswax, light honeysuckle, white peach, and light tropical fruit give this wine breadth as well as depth. It follows with hints of cracker, a medium weight, good balance and concentration and a clean, lingering finish.',\n",
       " 'A great success in 2008, this compelling Chardonnay offers concentrated, dense fruit flavors of lemon curd and sweet pineapple, along with streaks of vanilla cookie. Nuances reveal themselves through a lingering finish; fresh herb and hints of rock.',\n",
       " 'Bright and rustic, with ripe blackberry, cherry, blueberry, currant, tobacco and cedar flavors. Nice and spicy. Drink now.',\n",
       " \"Third in Three Brothers' series of four Rieslings, this bottling is accurately labeled as semi-sweet, although certainly sweeter than the 1st Degree. There's a consistency through the series with a savory nose of anise, fennel and petroleum. The mouth is full of ripe fruit—this time juicy honeydew and tangerines—and a hint of jasmine tea that adds astringency to the finish.\",\n",
       " 'An enormously opulent wine, brimming with gobs of red cherries, currants, mocha, clove, cinnamon and pepper flavors. Impresses for the lushness and integrity of the structure. Brilliant wine, just gorgeous, a real crowd-pleaser. With its recent track record, Kynsi enters the front ranks of California Pinot Noir producers.',\n",
       " 'Dark in color and full-bodied for a rosé, this dry wine is enormously concentrated in the ripest, sweetest red and black cherries. Turns increasingly complex in the mouth, showing layers of anise, vanilla and spice.',\n",
       " \"With more than 16% alcohol, this Zin has a hot mouthfeel, even for Dry Creek Zinfandel. Still, it's dry and smooth, with savory flavors of blackberry jam, chocolate, red and black currants, bacon and pepper. It's a good example of its type, and of Mazzocco's house style.\",\n",
       " 'From the oldest block of the estate vineyard, this fruit-driven Pinot is crisp and lively, mixing bright berry flavors with just a hint of sandalwood. Tannins are tamed, and the emphasis is clearly on purity of fruit.',\n",
       " 'One of the best Pinot Blancs of this or any vintage. It was mostly fermented in stainless steel, with about one-fifth in new French oak. Just beautiful, with the creamy lushness of a fine Chardonnay. The fruit flavor is all about ripe, zesty citrus, spicy pears, tangerines and tangy green apples.',\n",
       " 'Supple and structured, with ripe tannins, this wine offers a seamless mix of red and black fruit flavors, along with fragrant tobacco, fig jam and dark chocolate notes.',\n",
       " 'A pretty Pinot, polished and silky and dry, with complicated flavors of sour cherry candy, raspberry tart, orange zest, pepper and smoky cedar. Drink now through 2012.',\n",
       " \"This Chard displays a slightly unusual but appealing sweet and sour streak. The bouquet shows tart green apples, grapefruit, stewed fruit and sweet herbs, plus tangy green oak shadings. The palate delivers more of the same, with zingy citrus and crisp apple flavors, but also dry, leesy notes. There's both cream and pepper on the back end of this likeable, split-personality wine.\",\n",
       " 'This brings light flavors of leaf and hard cherry candy, with a hint of cola.After its quick start, the wine tails off gently.',\n",
       " \"Very spicy, with an intense bouquet of toast, seed and pungent herb. Rich and fruity in the mouth, it's a complex mix of melon, passion fruit, papaya, guava and sweet orange. The fruit salad rolls back into oaky, buttery flavors for a full-throttle finish. Another 15.5% effort from Airfield, but here the fruit can stand up to the barrels.\",\n",
       " 'One of the best Californian Pinot Gris currently available, this is rich, creamy and complex, and it would make for a great alternative to Chardonnay. This wine traditionally ages in used oak, which imparts just a hint of wood-driven sweetness to the pear, peach, mango and lime flavors.',\n",
       " 'Smells a bit underripe, with a whiff of fresh asparagus, and richness is missing in the mouth. The flavors are of citrus fruits, lees, oak and fresh herbs. Nicely dry and crisp, but rather lean.',\n",
       " \"This small, Sonoma County-focused producer headed south to make a rich, attention-grabbing wine, with aromas of dark raspberries, blackberries, pulverized cloves, black sage and tobacco leaf. The palate shows smoked beef with cherry syrup, lifted by juniper and pine sap on the midpalate and boisterous acidity. It's distinctive yet not showy.\",\n",
       " \"Hot in alcohol and sweet in ripe fruit and glycerine. Shows jammy flavors of raspberries, blackberries, cherries and chocolate, along with Zinfandel's peppery spices. Drink now.\",\n",
       " 'Subtle and crisp in profile, this not-quite-dry Riesling from Lakewood Vineyards is delicate in its soft, slightly underripe peach and apricot tones. Vibrant acidity and a clean, floral spray on the finish make it wonderfully refreshing.',\n",
       " 'This has not been a successful bottling over the years. The 2008, like its predecessors, is semi-sweet and candied, with crisp pineapple and lemon flavors and a bit of feline spray.',\n",
       " \"Shows the integrity of previous bottlings, but without the concentration or Northern Rhône-like quality of the last several vintages. The hot '04 harvest has made the wine simpler. Gone is the pepper and meat, replaced by fruit jam and chocolate. Drink this tasty, elegant wine now.\",\n",
       " 'A real success story for this hot vintage. Feels gracious and generous in the mouth, offering complex, fat flavors of blackberries, cherries, raspberries, mocha and cedar that turn spicy on the finish. The tannins are elaborately ripe and fine. The well-known vineyard is on the Rutherford bench, and production was 2,300 cases. Drinkable now, and should age well for at least a decade.',\n",
       " \"Made in the drier, leaner, earthier and more Chablisian style that's increasingly popular, this Chardonnay is a natural for food pairings, such as shellfish. It's a minerally wine, with elegant citrus, kiwi and pear flavors and a streamlined complexity.\",\n",
       " \"Good, but a bit thin and tannic, with a dry, astringent mouthfeel framing modest currant and herb flavors. Tastes like the kind of wine you want to age, but the stuffing isn't there.\",\n",
       " \"A candied nose introduces light fruit and there's and impression of some residual sugar on the finish. With extra breathing time tobacco and vanilla notes emerge, but the fruit is ephemeral.\",\n",
       " \"This vineyard-designated wine includes 13% Cabernet Sauvignon and 9% Syrah. The Syrah component seems to take over, in the form of tart berry, herb and dried leaf flavors. The alcohol, which is 15.5%, mutes any other complexities. It's a nice wine, but it doesn't offer standard Washington Merlot flavors.\",\n",
       " 'For the price, this is a pretty good deal. The wine is dry and rich in tannins, with blackberry, currant, tobacco, herb and cedar flavors.',\n",
       " \"This is a barrel selection from vines approaching 20 years of age. It's still quite tight, yet showing deeper riper fruit flavors than the Lylee. A judicious mix of cranberry, raspberry and black cherry, streaked with cola, contributes length, polish and texture to the finish. Drink 2018 through 2025.\",\n",
       " 'Native yeast, weekly batinage (lees stirring) in 50% new barrels, and, most importantly, a superb vineyard—Stillwater Creek—make for the best Chardonnay yet from Sparkman. Yeasty and young, dense and loaded with fresh pear, toasted nuts and butter, this is seductive and immensely enjoyable.',\n",
       " \"Cline makes interesting, offbeat red blends, and this composite of Syrah, Zinfandel, Petite Sirah, Alicante Bouchet and Mourvèdre comes from vineyards scattered all over California. It's a hearty, lusty wine, expressive in peppery cherry and mulberry flavors, and nicely dry. You'll be surprised at how rich it is at this price.\",\n",
       " 'Top lots from Sheridan, Dineen and Meek vineyard grapes go into this reserve. This is always the most thick and dense of the Stevens wines, and the tannins, though very well managed, are chewy and substantial. They dominate this young wine, but the stacked and subtle layers of red and black fruits, leaf and forest floor materials, moist earth and ashes keep the flavors complex and interesting. This wine absolutely must be decanted, and can be cellared almost indefinitely.',\n",
       " 'This elegant Cabernet Franc displays pronounced aromas of cherry, vanilla and raspberry, followed by fresh red berry and toast on the palate. Medium-bodies and balanced with fine tannins and a lingering finish. Pair with creamy cheeses, poultry, game.',\n",
       " \"The sheer deliciousness gives this wine its high score. It's like a decadent pastry dessert, with dark chocolate truffle, grilled black cherry, cassis, anise and sandalwood flavors sprinkled with cinnamon and pepper. But it's fully dry. The high alcohol and softness suggest drinking now.\",\n",
       " 'So easy to like for its soft richness. The raspberry and cherry fruit meets the toasted oak and creates an almost sweet, pastry taste. Wonderful now as a spicy alternative to Zinfandel.',\n",
       " 'A smashing success, this exceptional value is loaded with the typical fruit flavors of cut green apple, pineapple and melon. The fruit is set in a creamy frame and finished with beautifully restrained oak accents that support it without burying it.',\n",
       " 'This blend of Lodi Petite Sirah, Dry Creek Syrah and Dry Creek Zinfandel is dry, rustic and fruity. The tannic astringency suggests drinking with everyday fare, such as pasta with meatballs or pizza.',\n",
       " 'Aged in neutral oak and blended with 15% Cabernet Franc, this is a high-toned wine with sharp, vinegary acids, but not much character. Tannins are chewy and mask the fruit.',\n",
       " \"As its name states quite clearly, this is a plush, lush, smooth red wine. It's sweet and jammy like a shot of Jell-O.\",\n",
       " 'A very rich Syrah, packed with pepper, blackberries, currants, cherries, cola and licorice, and wrapped into the smoothest tannins you can imagine. Offers a lot of complexity and a beautiful, long finish.',\n",
       " \"This is an excellent Syrah, and it's right up there with the winery's Clone 877 bottling. It's nearly identical, with rich, sweet tannins, crisp acids and complex, intricate flavors of blackberries, plums, coffee, white pepper, sweet leather and smoky oak. The finish is dry and satisfying.\",\n",
       " 'Rough and gritty in texture and overtly sweet in pineapple, orange, peach and bubble gum flavors, this everyday bubbly finishes clean and honeyed.',\n",
       " \"For those unfamiliar with Arneis, it's a little like Sauvignon Blanc or Pinot Grigio, with citrus, apple and kiwi flavors. It's also high in acidity and dry, making it ideal as a cocktail sipper with savory small appetizers.\",\n",
       " 'Ah, the Resonance vineyard! This is a magic spot that consistently makes the best wines from this top winery. In 2006 elegance is the keynote; with everything in perfect proportion and the fruit, acid, tannin and barrel notes in perfect harmony. The wine is young, almost austere, and the flavors are compact and wedged together, but they are there to be found if you sniff and look. The fruit is concentrated in the back of the palate and this wine perfectly captures an Oregon aesthetic without any of the rough edges or rawness. Will it age? The bet from here is it will go another 20 years.',\n",
       " \"Pear, pineapple and citrus aromas with spearmint accents comprise the bouquet of this Russian River favorite. The wine is round and soft with tea, lemon, tropical fruit and buttercream flavors. It's light- to medium- weight, but with enough complexity to hold the taster's interest, and a persistent, tangy, sweet and sour back-end fade.\",\n",
       " 'The blend is 77% Cab, 12% Merlot, 11% Cab Franc and the alcohol, rather surprisingly, hits 15+%. This is a wonderful claret, with mixed red and blue fruits and berries, plenty of natural acid and no obvious oak. There is a flash of caramel and mocha at the end, but the flavors unwrap luxuriously in a series of gradient layers. Delivers a lot of quality for the dollars. 1,100 cases made.',\n",
       " \"Here's a pretty little glass of red wine, silky and supple, with a brisk mouthfeel revealing ripe cherry and tobacco flavors with a hint of cocoa. It's dry, tart in acids and superversatile at the table.\",\n",
       " \"From the producer's estate vineyard, the grapes planted on budwood from Napa Valley's famous Three Palms, this wine is bittersweet in tannin and flavor, a mix of blueberry, cedar, resin and clove. Full bodied in style, it maintains an elegance on the finish, marked irresistibly in dark chocolate.\",\n",
       " 'Very rich and complicated. Shows pie-filling flavors of cherries, raspberries and red currants, seasoned with anise, vanilla, cocoa, black pepper and cinnamon. Easy to enjoy this elegant, delicious wine.',\n",
       " \"A beautiful, succulent young Cabernet-based Bordeaux blend that delivers plenty of flavor. It's front-loaded with blackberries, cherries, currants and chocolate. Delicious now, but it's a little too soft for the cellar.\",\n",
       " \"With their '05 reserve, Reverie has produced possibly their greatest Cabernet Sauvignon ever. But be forewarned, it needs cellaring. Not a long time, just enough to soften and sweeten a bit. Right now, the tannins shove to the front of the line, pushing aside the delicious blackberries and currants. But the wine has Bordeaux-like elegance. Even a few years in the bottle will help resolve things.\",\n",
       " \"This is not as good a Pinot as Morgan's Garys' Vineyard. The main problem is overripe fruit. The wine has a baked, almost burnt pie-filling quality. Hard to say why two Pinots grown so close together are so different, but that's terroir for you.\",\n",
       " \"Dramatically rich and ripe, a bells and whistles Chardonnay made in the white Burgundy style. It's flamboyant in pineapple, nectarine, guava and oak- and lees-influenced buttered toast, cream and vanilla crème brûlée, but it's also very acidic and dry, which provides balance and elegance. Fine now and for 3 or 4 years.\",\n",
       " 'Good and dry, with complex layers of blackberries, black cherries, tobacco, herbs and oak. The tannins are wonderfully firm and refined. Suffers a little from excessive acidity, which makes it uncomfortably sharp. Drink now.',\n",
       " 'Delicately light yet showing a fascinating amount of character on both the nose and palate, this bottling by winemaker Nathan Kandler offers aromas of lightly pressed cherries, purple sage, juniper, eucalyptus oil and a hint of mushrooms. The sip sings with cola, raspberries, pencil lead, morel mushrooms and forest-floor flavorings.',\n",
       " 'Nice and dry, with an elegant structure of acids and firm, dusty tannins and a balanced application of oak. However, the wine is a bit thin and lacking in richness, especially compared to Napa. It shows herb-tinged, earthy flavors that suggest black cherries, green olives and golden tobacco.',\n",
       " 'Ripe berry, subtle herb and slight earth notes combine to produce an elegant, complex wine with beautiful balance. The palate offers solid flavors and texture and the wine finishes well, with decent length and berry, cocoa and toast elements. Best Buy.',\n",

Better after 2012.\",\n",
       " 'In this lively, delicately balanced wine from an exceptional vineyard, an exuberance of pear and tangerine plays on the palate, buoyed by focused minerality. With just the right touch of ripeness and richness, it ends with a suggestion of lemon custard.',\n",
       " 'This is sharp, acidic and tannic, with hints of blackberry fruit, but too much VA and no depth.',\n",
       " 'Richness and rusticity ride side by side in this Pinot Noir. It has enormously ripe raspberry, cherry and persimmon flavors, with a balanced jacket of oak and crisp acidity. On the other hand, the tannins are edgy, giving the wine a jagged feeling. The wine will age for many years, without gaining complexity.',\n",
       " \"This is a white Rhône blend of Grenache Blanc, Roussanne and Viognier. It's dry and crisply acidic and minerally, with pleasant citrus and peach fruitiness. Think of a cross between a zesty Sauvignon Blanc and a rich Chardonnay.\",\n",

Concentrated, thick black raspberry and black cherry fruit centers a substantial wine, laced with vivid streaks of vanilla, tobacco and spice. The immediate impact of the fruit is amplified by the density on the palate, and the finish, loaded with baking spices, reflects the aging in one-third new French oak barrels.\",\n",
       " 'A Meritage blend of 70% Cabernet Sauvignon, 15% Merlot, 10% Cabernet Franc, 4% Malbec and 1% Petit Verdot, this is deep, rich and chewy, without having excessive alcohol.

The tannins are slightly grainy, fully ripe and wreathed in a smoke note, and the length is superb.',\n",

Aromatic with cedar wood smoke, its flavors recall black tea, tobacco and smoked paprika. The fruit is ripe and full, but it's the nonfruit complexity that captivates. The balance is just right, and for the price, it's a unique and fascinating wine.\",\n",
       " \"This blush wine shows plenty of Merlot fruit in the form of cherries and raspberries. It's slightly sweet to off-dry, with pleasant acidity providing balance.\",\n",
       " 'Beautifully fragrant with citrus blossom and beeswax, lime and Meyer lemon. In the mouth it is wonderfully full with white peaches, apricot, citrus rind, hints of gooseberry, some honey and tea flavors also. Long, silky, persistent, clean and pure. In the glass it seems to gain flesh as it smoothes and rounds out; truly a wonderful, silky, voluptuous wine — as good as it gets.',\n",
       " \"Structure and elegance mark this fine blend of Cabernet Sauvignon, Cabernet Franc and Merlot. The blackberry, cherry and black currant flavors are nicely ripe, yet the wine modulates them with crisp acidity and tannins that have a bite of astringency, which of course suggests roasts and grilled steaks. A lovely wine that's best now and through 2012.\",\n",
       " 'Rather heavy and soft and overtly sweet, but delicious, with a swirl of pineapple, Meyer lemon, apricot, peach, vanilla, cinnamon, white chocolate and honey flavors. Nice as a cocktail sipper, and maybe with spicy Vietnamese or Thai food.',\n",
       " 'Fragrant and sharp edged, with citrus rind flavors, and a hint of bitterness around the tight fruit flavors. As it breathes, pretty, concentrated fruit flavors emerge, suggesting marmalade and apricot preserves. It finishes with a light touch, tart and bracing.',\n",
       " \"The overwhelming impression is of strong, astringently dry tannins that absolutely limit pleasure. Is it worth cellaring? There's a deep core of black cherry and cassis fruit and adequate acidity. The wine will undoubtedly throw sediment and soften, but that doesn't equate to improvement. Your best bet is to decant and drink with rich, fatty meats and cheeses.\",\n",
       " \"A pleasantly drinkable, rich Claret out of Lake County's Guenoc, moderate in alcohol (13.5%) with cranberry, raspberry and chocolate on the nose and intermingled with the vanilla and cinnamon from the oak, half of it American. A fine addition to the backyard barbecue.\",\n",
       " \"Although basically an earthy wine that was most likely produced from vineyards where the yields were stretched to the max to keep the price down, it does have its charms. You'll find enough black-cherry flavors to satisfy, and the tannins are soft and firm. It's dry as dust. The right foods (perhaps roast pork) will coax out its inherent sweetness.\",\n",
       " 'The softness and rusticity that almost always mark Sierra Foothills wines are here, yet the wine rises to what might be called coastal elegance. A Spanifornia blend of Tempranillo and Cab Sauvignon, it has a complexity that unfolds in waves of blackberry, tobacco, clove, anise and espresso. Drink now.',\n",
       " \"After the terrific 2003 Ulysses this is a come-down. Sweaty and tight, with a tart, unyielding palate, this herbal, peppery wine requires some effort. Released too soon? Most certainly, but it's a good question whether the chocolaty oak will ever smooth into the light, tart fruit flavors of red berry and pomegranate.\",\n",
       " 'The flagship of Krug\\'s new Limited Release offerings, IX Clones refers to the nine different clones of Cabernet Sauvignon that comprise this wine. The result is more complexity than in the \"regular\" Limited Release Cab and a firmer, chewier finish that suggests cellaring 4-7 years prior to consumption. It\\'s full and creamy-textured on the palate, with aromas and flavors that hint at smoke, cassis, tobacco, cedar and a multitude of dried spices. Should be great, starting in 2010. Only problem? Just 75 cases were produced.',\n",
       " \"A nice, medium-bodied red wine to drink with spicy, rich fare, like ham and sausage dishes. It's very dry and brisk in dusty tannins, with flavors of black cherries, Dr. Pepper, herbs, Asian spices and sweet sandalwood. Syrah, Petite Sirah and Cabernet Sauvignon.\",\n",
       " \"This is the winery's most expensive bottling, a late disgorged bubbly that has now seen a decade of age. It shows the elegant polish of the '97 Royal Cuvée, but is superior even to it in richness. The creamy smoothness is the star attraction, but so are the subtle citrus, raspberry, brioche and vanilla flavors. Impeccably dry balance guarantees that this beautiful brut will age effortlessly for 10 years, if not longer.\",\n",
       " \"Côtes de Tablas is Tablas Creek's number two white, after their Esprit de Beaucastel. The '06 is a blend of Viognier, Marsanne, Grenache Blanc and Roussanne. It's a satisfying wine, somewhat sweet and simple in apricot, peach and pineapple flavors.\",\n",
       " 'Dry and soft, with the taste of cherry, roasted almond, crunchy granola and fig health candy bar. Enjoyable, but simple. Drink now.',\n",
       " 'Most of the grapes come from this cool-climate growing area, giving the wine a peppery aroma and flavor. The winemaker included 15% Syrah from the warmer home ranch in the Santa Ynez Valley. A good choice, as that adds a fat, soft richness. Finishes fully dry, firm in acidity and finely tannic, with ripe flavors of blackberries. Drink now.',\n",
       " \"This is one of those Sauvignons that has that grassy, gooseberry aroma and flavor that approaches ammonia, but stops just short in favor of lemons and limes. It's crisp and a little sweet.\",\n",
       " 'Just 100 cases (four barrels) made it into the reserve, sourced from the Pommard vineyard blocks. A slight step beyond the outstanding “regular” Schindler, this is chewier, blockier, all-around bigger. Same plummy, dried cherry fruit flavors, with compelling details of forest floor and tobacco. Gets more delicious through the finish, which seems to hang in the throat for a long while.',\n",
       " \"Half and half Grenache and Mourvèdre, this rich wine is superripe in jammy blackberry, cherry, orange and root beer flavors. It's not exactly dry, but not really sweet. Very high alcohol creates a peppery burn.\",\n",
       " \"No oak lets the basic wine show through, but the problem is that it's unbalanced. It's sugary sweet in peach and apricot flavors, with a harsh, burnt finish.\",\n",
       " \"Dry, complex and elegant, this is a multivineyard blend that shows a fine expression of Santa Rita terroir. It's young and vibrant now, perhaps at the peak of its seductiveness, with an elaborate array of cherry, raspberry, cola and smoky oak flavors.\",\n",
       " \"Smooth and rich, this is a nice mix of ripe purple fruits and expensive new oak. It's soft and seamless, ready to drink right now, with all the vanilla and butterscotch flavors that lovers of big red wines look for. It fades in the finish, leaving a slightly bitter, medicinal aftertaste.\",\n",
       " 'This new Uriah marks a return to form; big, brawny, chewy and complex, yet generous and complete. The blend continues as before—54% Merlot, 33% Cab Franc, 7% Petit Verdot, and 6% Malbec, all estate-grown. The wine opens with barrel scents and flavors of tea, tobacco and wood smoke. The cherry-flavored fruit saturates the tobacco notes, gaining mass and turning into cherry cobbler as it does.',\n",
       " \"Another lovely Gewurz from Navarro. Made with neutral oak fermentation, it's rich and crisp and spicy, with a mélange of exotic fruit and wildflower flavors.\",\n",
       " 'A faint floral perfume lingers amidst the fresh apple and pear aromas on this dry, minerally Finger Lakes Riesling with a refreshing lemon-lime palate. Bracingly high acidity and a brisk lime pith astringency lead the way to a long, puckery finish.',\n",
       " 'Direct in fruit, simple in structure, this Cab shows ripe blackberry, cherry, chocolate, vanilla and spice flavors. Best enjoyed with easy fare like hamburgers and such.',\n",
       " 'A massive wine that could only have been grown under the California sun. Shows enormously ripe flavors of red and black currants, cola, red plums and spices, enriched with significant oak. Not particularly nuanced or elegant now due to the obvious power. Could age out, but the future is uncertain.',\n",
       " 'This is a relatively gentle, light Cabernet Franc. It reveals a pretty, juicy blueberry flavor as well as a muted herb note. A whiff of violet and a dash of vanilla run through the finish.',\n",
       " \"You'll find beautiful, lush, complex, fruit-driven aromas here, as with all the L'Ecole white wines. This captures the complexity of the grape—rarely seen in domestic Chenin Blanc—ripe apples, spice, hints of honey and caramel, and a lovely, persistent floral overtone. In short, this is the Chenin Blanc that should be made, that can be made, and that is rarely made in this state.\",\n",
       " \"A savory, meaty and brooding Sangiovese that's rustic and simultaneously pretty, with an air of soft perfume on the nose. This small-production wine, with tiny bits of Barbera and Primitivo mixed in, would be really good with risotto.\",\n",
       " 'Fresh from the vineyard, this Pinot Grigio from the 2007 vintage is bright and zesty in tart lemon, lime, apple and vanilla flavors, with a sweeter edge of figs. It finishes with a crisp, honeyed aftertaste.',\n",
       " 'With the heat of very high alcohol, the taste of overripe, raisiny fruit and a sweet finish, this is not a successful wine. But then, Mourvèdre is notoriously difficult to control.',\n",
       " 'True to its name, the wine is crimson in color, and sweet, with honeyed raspberry, cherry and vanilla flavors. Easy to drink due to the balanced sweetness.',\n",
       " \"Clean and fruity, this 2008 vintage drinks more like a 2007—light, elegant, with tart, strawberry fruit flavors. It's pleasant but ethereal; a little more concentration would be a plus.\",\n",
       " \"As with previous vintages, this rare wine spent 38 months in barrel. Smooth and supple, it's a lush expression of purple and black fruits, generously endowed with darker flavors of smoke, tar, soy and licorice. There is a compelling, yet subtle, umami character overriding all else. It's drinking quite beautifully now, but could age considerably longer.\",\n",
       " 'A little one-dimensional, but otherwise a nice, everyday Pinot Noir with good varietal character. With a silky texture, it has dry, clean flavors of cherries, cola, spices and oak.',\n",
       " 'Yeasty, honeyed, aromatic and rich with floral, citrus blossom, peach, apricot and spiced orange pekoe tea notes.',\n",
       " \"At 12g/L residual sugar, this just barely qualifies as dry. Fruit flavors suggest lemon curd and green pineapple, and there's an interesting savory note. But flatness across the palate keeps the score from going higher.\",\n",
       " 'Another excellent Riesling from Keuka Lake Vineyards, this light-bodied, semi-dry wine is fragrant with apple blossoms and an intensely ripe pommelo palate. Refreshingly clean with an abundance of minerality and a brisk acidity, it finishes sweetly on a gentle lemon-lime note.',\n",
       " 'Light red cherry, dried sage, black tea and thyme show on the nose of this bottling from the iconic facility in the heart of its namesake valley. There is a lot of action on the palate, where tart cherry and plum skin flavors meet with dried mint and earthy shrub elements.',\n",
       " 'The palate can tell a superbly structured Cabernet from a flawed one, and this Cab shows off its pedigreed origins with flash. Great tannins, fine acidity, fully dry, and with a rich veneer of oak, it has perfectly ripened flavors of blackberries, currants, cherries and dark chocolate.',\n",
       " \"Rich and oaky, this Chard has flavors of vanilla custard, caramel, butterscotch, pineapple jam, Meyer lemons and pear tart with the crust. It's a crowd-pleaser that will appeal to legions of Chardonnay lovers.\",\n",
       " \"Most consumers will open this too soon and miss where it's going, but even now, in its extreme youth, it's satisfying. Bone dry and crisp, with an elegantly silky texture, it shows refined flavors of cherries, minerals, cola, olive tapenade, tea and spices, and is a fine example of Carneros Pinot. But such are the tannins and acids that the wine will evolve through the next six years.\",\n",
       " 'Half Cabernet Franc and 25% each Tannat and Malbec, this rough-and-tumble red is tannic and earthy. That tannic stiffness might subside with further bottle age, but this wine may be best opened soon and served with spicy, hearty food.',\n",
       " 'This is 80% Sangiovese and 20% Syrah; an overlooked treasure from the LeFore vineyard, one of the original plantings in the Rocks. It is now beginning to show more genuine Sangiovese character as it moves into its second decade. Spicy berry with a strong coffee back, and the juicy acidity of the grape providing the structure. It finishes with a bright cinnamon streak. Delicious.',\n",
       " \"The vineyard has been the source to some of Goldeneye's deepest, most profound wines, and the '05 certainly is big and cellar-worthy. It's somewhat tannic, and very deep in black cherries and blackberries, with rich complexities of figs, dusty spices and smoky oak. The power of this wine is considerable, yet it somehow retains the light silkiness of great Pinot Noir.\",\n",
       " \"Shows a greater elegance and finesse than Easton's other current Zins, reflected in the smooth, ripe tannins, balancing acids and dry finish. Then there are the flavors, extraordinarily rich in blackberry pie, espresso and peppery spice. This is classic California mountain Zin.\",\n",
       " \"Tart and chocolaty, this red blend is smoky, earthy and substantial. It carries the winery's characteristic roasted coffee and bitter chocolate flavors through the big, tannic finish. It's a good, all-purpose red, with firm fruit and even firmer tannins holding up the back end.\",\n",
       " 'This two-acre site dates back to 1975; this is only the fourth time that Ponzi has offered it as a designate. Muscular and authoritative, it is still compact and somewhat unyielding. Dark cherry and cassis fruit is packed with iron filings, coffee grounds and black licorice. Winemaker Luisa Ponzi does her usual excellent job of putting the polish on outstanding fruit. Give it another decade and it will show its best.',\n",
       " \"Good, deep flavors in this dry Cabernet. They include well-developed blackberries, black currants, dark chocolate and tobacco, with savory hints of licorice, black pepper and cinnamon toast, smeared with plum jam. The texture could be a little smoother, as it's somewhat gritty.\",\n",
       " 'Lots to like in this Cab Franc. Shows ripe, attractive cherry compote, black raspberry purée, cola, cocoa, coffee and spice flavors, with a rich, earthy edge of balsamic, sautéed mushroom and oaky vanilla. Then there are the tannins. They kick in and give the wine a youthful, lively structure. Very nice wine, but be sure to decant it for a few hours.',\n",
       " \"A brand new line from K-J. This very attractive wine has lush fruit and spice flavors, with maximum extract. Tannins and acids all are adequate. What K-J seems to be aiming for is a new flavor, neither Cabernet nor Syrah but in-between, and they've succeeded. Yes, it's simple and uncomplicated, but there's plenty of pleasure for the money. Best Buy.\",\n",
       " 'Shows the thick, furry tannins Petite Sirah is known for, with some good black currant, anise and cedar flavors. Feels a bit sharp, with a cut of mint. Drink now.',\n",
       " \"A spicy wine, dry and firm in tannins, that's balanced enough to accompany food such as beef prepared with lots of spices and pepper. It shows Zin's briary, brambly profile, with wild berry and balsamic flavors, and seems best in its lusty youth.\",\n",
       " \"Similar to the excellent 2005, this bottling needs some time in the cellar to let the fruit, tannins, acids and oak knit together. Tasted in early winter of 2009, it's fresh and dramatic, with ripe flavors of cherries, raspberries, currants, cola, licorice, orange zest and cedar. Try toward 2010.\",\n",
       " \"A very rich Chardonnay, explosive in lemon custard, grilled pineapple and the ripest peaches imaginable. At the same time, there's a firm, tangy minerality. Some will find, however, that the oak dominates it all with a blast of buttered toast and caramel.\",\n",
       " \"Dazzles now for its richness. Shows those classic Howell Mountain tannins, but they've been so tamed and refined, you can drink it now. The flavors are spectacular, over the top; pure Cirque du Soleil spectacle of blackberry, currant and chocolate acrobatics.\",\n",
       " \"Unrelieved in acidity and dryness, this red wine is hard to like. The flavors are of slightly bitter, shriveled berries. It's not flawed, just made in this style.\",\n",
       " 'Bone dry and vegetal, with high acidity. Saved, just barely, by some good cherry and oak flavors.',\n",
       " \"Right on the heels of their excellent 2014 version, this ups the ante still further. Young and forward, it's nonetheless well-balanced and ready for prime-time drinking. Bright raspberry and cherry fruit abounds, with the freshness and supporting acidity to age nicely for up to a decade.\",\n",
       " \"This is a soft, semi-sweet wine with rich flavors of cherry and raspberry jam, bacon, black pepper and sandalwood. It's a little syrupy. Give it a chill in the fridge before drinking.\",\n",
       " \"A slick of wax and lanolin lends a mineral tone to bright apple cider and honey notes in this sprightly semisweet Riesling. Spine-tingling with acidity, it's an elegant, classically styled wine with a pristine, fruit-focused finish.\",\n",
       " \"From the Los Alamos region, this young, firm Pinot wants a little time in the bottle to mellow. Tasted in January, it's unresolved in tannins, fresh acidity, oak (76% new) and primary cherry and raspberry fruit. Should be a very fine wine sometime toward 2011.\",\n",
       " \"Raspberries, cherries, cola, exotic spices and sweet cedar mark the flavors of this Pinot Noir. It's elegant in the mouth, with brisk acidity, but also a distinct earthiness. The combination gives the wine a yin-yang of weight and weightlessness. It's too young to properly enjoy now, so drink from 2019 and beyond.\",\n",
       " \"Here's a minerally, acidic, very dry Chard with a firm structure. Slightly earthy, it has citrus fruit, smoky oak and spice flavors, with a wet stone, metallic tang in the finish.\",\n",
       " 'A fine Pinot, with the lush, silky texture you expect from this variety. The flavors are rich, of sour cherries, red plums, red currants, herb tea, orange zest, cinnamon and pepper. The finish is very dry and firm in tannins. Should develop well over the next six years.',\n",
       " 'Very ripe and oaky, but a little on the obvious side, with flamboyant tropical fruit, honey and buttered toast flavors. Could use greater finesse, subtlety, complexity.',\n",
       " \"Positioned as the top wine in the massive Erath lineup, La Nuit Magique was not made in 2007, but it's back in 2008. A welcome relief from all the single-vineyard wines, this blends the top barrels from excellent vineyards, slathers them in chocolaty oak, and the result is a palate-pleasing, open, warm, generous wine which might come from California. Sappy berry compote, enlivened with juicy acids, and finished with plenty of sweet, toasty oak.\",\n",
       " \"To call this a big Cab would be an understatement. It's a black-colored, saturated wine that detonates on the palate, offering a blast of black and red berries, currants, cassis, dark unsweetened chocolate, anise and fine, upscale new oak. But the tannins are fierce. Very fine, among the best St. Helena Cabernets of the vintage. Needs time. 2012–2020.\",\n",
       " 'Aromas of toast and dried herbs-even flowers-mingle on the nose, then give way to juicy black-cherry flavors that linger through the finish, where coffee and caramel chime in, adding welcome complexity.',\n",
       " \"One of the first wines from De Loach after the Boisset takeover, this dry Gewürz is a good portent for the future. It's ultraclean and crisp, with very deep and satisfying flavors of Asian spices, peaches, litchi and citrus.\",\n",
       " \"A little too harsh and raw, and there's heat from high alcohol, although there are other things to like about this Zin. It's dry and spicy, with complex wild berry, currant, cola and beef jerky flavors. The alcohol is 15.4%.\",\n",
       " 'Full-flavored, broadly-displayed and engaging with a mix of cranberry, raspberry and Bing cherry, this tasty Pinot Noir fills in the back end with pleasing barrel flavors. Buttered toast and caramel give it a smooth and creamy finish, and the alcohol is right at 13.5%.',\n",
       " 'This Bordeaux blend is showing its youth with a rawly acidic scour that frames jammy, fairly sweet cherry and cassis flavors, and feels disjointed. But it may just need some time in the bottle. Try after 2008. No guarantees.',\n",
       " \"Nice and lush, one of the easier Grenaches on the market. It's soft and silky, with ripe flavors of cherries, mocha and spices. A touch (10% new) of oak adds just the right touch of smoke.\",\n",
       " 'A blend of Cabernet Sauvignon, Syrah and Merlot, this is dry, smooth, rich and delicious, and it offers waves of ripe blackberry, crème de cassis, dark chocolate and charred meat flavors, plus the spiciness of sweet licorice and pepper. It can be consumed now, but it will also develop for 3–4 years.',\n",
       " \"Smells and tastes of a piece, a lush, smooth wine of considerable appeal. Although it's a bit soft and melted, the blend, which is mainly Cabernet Sauvignon, shows delicious blackberry, black currant, licorice, cedar and spice flavors.\",\n",

       " \"A huge, complex wine that flatters the palate with enormously rich, layered flavors of lemondrop, vanilla custard and butterscotch flavors. Fortunately, there's crisp Central Coast acidity.\",\n",
       " \"A lovely Cabernet, rich and ripe in blackberries and cassis, with a touch of herbs and a little heat from high alcohol. A good steak, with its salty fattiness, will take care of that. But it's tannic. Not so much that you can't drink it now, but it really wants a year or two in the cellar.\",\n",
       " 'They pulled out their best for their birthday, and the result is a spectacular wine. Dense and concentrated in enormously complex cassis, black currant, cherry pie and cedar, it shows the dryness and firm tannins of a fine young Cabernet. Easy to predict a good lifetime ahead.

       " \"Showing the usual balance and harmony of this bottling, which is made from the five Bordeaux varieties, the '06 nonetheless lacks a bit of the richness of other vintages.

       " \"This wine is silky and well-balanced in acids and tannins, with judicious oak influences framing complex cherry, red currant and spice flavors. Feels very rich, yet the alcohol is a modest 13.7% by volume.

Only 86 cases produced.',\n",
       " 'Bright, brash fruit sets this off on the right note, with raspberries and strawberries and even a little watermelon in the mix. Fruit defines the middle, and extends through to the full, ripe finish.',\n",
       " 'Tasted in late winter, this blend of Cabernet (85%) and Syrah (15%) was fruity and chocolaty, with a pastry sweetness that was a bit simple. But by early summer it had acquired greater depth and balance, and seemed drier and better structured. Shows real charm and finesse. Drink now–2010.',\n",
       " \"The winery calls this a “trocken” style. It's aromatic with a mouthwatering juiciness (though not too puckery) that invites a second (and third) glass. The alcohol is a moderate 12.5%, making this a perfect summer all-purpose, all-food sipping wine.\",\n",
       " 'Silky and crisp, this Pinot plays it right down the middle, offering an immediately appealing savor, but with enough complexity for purists. The cherry, red currant and black raspberry flavors are finished with 50% new French oak.',\n",
       " 'May be going through a muted phase, but tasted in the Fall of 2010, this wine was somewhat muted, despite the currant and cedar flavors. It also displayed some raisin-skin bitterness. Could have been a victim of the heat waves that year.',\n",
       " \"New oak and ripe fruit combine to produce a user-friendly Chardonnay that's made in the popular style. It's enormous in pineapple, orange, mango and vanilla flavors that are brightened by crisp Carneros acidity.\",\n",
       " 'Tastes dry and sharp in acids, a young, tart wine not offering much pleasure now, despite good cherry, cola, red licorice and sandalwood flavors. Needs a little time, but not too much. Give it a year to calm down.',\n",
       " 'Roughly three-fifths Merlot and two-fifths Cab Franc, this saw 19 months in mostly new French and American oak. Like its stable-mates at Basel it puts the barrel ahead of the fruit which, though pretty enough, does not have the depth of flavor to match. The finish carries some rough tannins and a hint of heat.',\n",
       " 'Leathery and somewhat green, this wine has yet to find its balance, combining 95% Cabernet Sauvignon with 3% Malbec and 2% Petit Verdot. It veers between heavy, ripe tension and an underripe underbelly, finishing unsure.',\n",
       " 'Marred by a vegetal taste, this has hot, thin cherry and oak flavors. The blend is Mourvèdre, Zinfandel and Grenache.',\n",
       " 'Fruity, soft and candied, this high alcohol wine has blackberry and cherry pie filling flavors, with a rustic texture. Cabernet Sauvignon, Syrah and a few other varieties.',\n",
       " \"Rich, tannic and spicy, a classic Sonoma Zinfandel with enough elegance to pair with upscale food. It's a little hot in alcohol and overripe, but wears it proudly, celebrating its Zinny personality with a sweet flourish. That's characterisic of the vineyard, which is on a warm ridge within this cool appellation.\",\n",
       " \"This is a very rich wine. Complex, too. With every sip, it seems to offer a little more of itself. On the surface, it's dry, tannic and fruity, with blackberry, black currant, dark chocolate and cedar flavors. But it has mineral and herb nuances that seem to spring from the soil, and the depth and finish are impressive. Drinkable now for sheer luxury, and should continue to develop over the next decade.\",\n",
       " \"Inky black, very tannic and bone dry, this Syrah needs lots of decanting, or time in the cellar. Otherwise, it's just too ornery. Deep down inside is an intense core of blackberries and currants that longs to emerge. Hold at least until 2009.\",\n",
       " \"Tastes riper than Peachy's other '04 Zins, with alcohol close to 16%, and some Petite Sirah in the blend. The wine is enormous in blackberry jam, cassis and blueberry pie flavors. Fabulous, exotic and just delicious, with gobs of chocolate.\",\n",
       " 'A brilliant Chardonnay, displaying both the terroir of this fine upland part of Monterey County, and the cool vintage that let the grapes hang on the vines until they were perfectly ripe. Dazzles with pineapple and mango fruit, with a perfect jacket of sweet, vanilla-scented oak. Best of all is the acidity, which is brisk, bright and clean.',\n",
       " \"This is something you're not likely to see every day—a 10-year-old sparkling wine made from 100% Pinot Gris. Lacks the finesse and minerality of those Alsatian sparkling wines, but the flavors have been smoothed out over the years, and a pleasing toasty streak has crept into the tart pear skin fruit.\",\n",
       " \"Made in a very dry and acidic style, this wine has flavors of limes, honeydew melons and buttercream. It's tight and minerally, with a tart, high-acid finish, and seems designed to complement food.\",\n",
       " \"A nice, everyday Pinot, with a properly silky texture. The cherry, cola, red licorice and bacon flavors are satisfyingly rich, with elaborate oak overtones. It's a pretty good value in an under-$20 Pinot Noir.\",\n",
       " \"Good Pinot, fairly full-bodied, and deep and long in red stone-fruit flavors and dusty spices. But it's also fairly tannic, and a bit sharp in the finish. Drink now.\",\n",
       " 'Impresses for the sheer volume of fruit, offering waves of pie filling raspberries, cherries and red currants, with notes of cocoa, bacon, sweet oak and savory spices. A good bite of Central Coast acidity fortunately brings briskness to the richness. Drink now–2012.',\n",
       " 'Fans of powerful, fruit-driven Zinfandel will exult in this monster of a wine. It is an explosion of blueberry, raspberry, plum, blackberry, chocolate-covered raisin and sandalwood flavors. This is tannic, and the high alcohol gives it a glycerine-driven sweetness.',\n",
       " \"This mountain Cab is dependably hard in youthful tannins on release. That won't stop most people from drinking it too young, but with its rich, deep cassis flavors, it would be a shame to pop the cork before 2010.\",\n",
       " 'Dry and balanced, this is a great food wine, with its crunchy acidity and minerality. A combination of Roussanne, Grenache Blanc and Piquepol, it shows nuanced flavors of the zests of Meyer lemons and limes, figs and green melons. Robert Hall is producing some of the most interesting white wines in Paso Robles.',\n",
       " \"A rich, dry young Cabernet, with fresh blackberry, cherry and oak flavors, brightened by a burst of citrusy acidity. The tannins are strong, however, giving the wine a sandpapery astringency. Needs a few years, although it doesn't have the stuffing for the long haul. Your window is around 2014.\",\n",
       " 'The taste is dominated by sweet vanilla and caramelly oak. Buried under that are tropical fruit, pear and kiwi flavors. While the acidity is nice and crisp, the wine is too oaky.',\n",
       " \"Sobra is Brazilian Portuguese for leftovers. It's a Bordeaux blend, but the recipe changes every year. This is very nice and drinking well, smooth with a nicely resolved mix of black fruits, smoky wood, pepper and a bit of bacon fat.\",\n",
       " \"While decidedly sweet on the nose with a scent reminiscent of candied apples, Lucas' rosé is surprisingly dry on the palate. Full bodied with a densely extracted black cherry juice note, it's a fairly substantial rosé with a nip of astringency on the finish.\",\n",
       " \"A heavy, softly ripe, super-extracted Cabernet. If you like sheer power, you'll get off on the massive blackberries, black currants, milk chocolate and caramelized oak.\",\n",
       " \"Seems made in a less ripe style, a minty, wintergreen wine with hints of barely ripened blackberries and some briary wild berries. Drinks bone dry and fairly tannic. If you're into an earthier, more French Bordeaux style, try this one. Will benefit from a decade of aging.\",\n",
       " 'Sharp acidity makes this young wine a bit tart now. It has solid flavors of cherries, raspberries, bacon and smoky sandalwood, and is dry and silky. Decant for a few hours, or better yet, give it a year or two in the cellar.',\n",
       " \"A controversial wine due to its amazing power. It's just tremendous in apricot, peach, nectarine, marzipan and crème brûlée flavors, like some dainty from a great pastry chef. But this oversized quality makes it difficult to enjoy with food. Almost better on its own as a cocktail sipper.\",\n",
       " 'This is pure Cabernet Sauvignon, with pretty, ripe berry and plum fruit flavors in abundance. The toasty frame, medium tannins and hints of dried leaf add to the overall composition of this nicely-balanced, limited-production wine.',\n",
       " \"A bit overripe, with some pruney, raisiny aromas and flavors. If you can get past that, you'll find a dry, tannic wine with essential blackberries and currants. A Bordeaux blend based on Merlot.\",\n",
       " 'This classy Bordeaux blend is lightly laced with coconut, caramel and toffee; just right. A skillful hand is at work here. This is a soft, seductive wine with great balance and charm.',\n",
       " 'Pale peach in color with savory aromas of apple, pear and buttered toast, this softly pétillant brut rosé hits the palate a touch sweet. Made from Pinot Noir with a splash of Chardonnay, it balances bracingly high acidity with rich, buttery biscuit flavors and a dry finish.',\n",
       " 'Bold, penetrating tannins and bright cranberry acidity lend a tight frame to this classically styled Blaufränkisch, a.k.a. Lemberger. Crisp-tart blackberry and blueberry flavors are accented by bramble and herb notes that linger long on the finish. Its quite closed now, but should show well after 2018.',\n",
       " \"An awesome wine. So delicious and complex now in wild cherry, raspberry, Dr. Pepper cola, bacon and smoky sandalwood flavors, brightened with crisp acidity and totally dry despite the fruitiness. But you'll also find a firm tannic structure that gives it some astringency. It's the kind of Pinot Noir that California does at its best, drinkable now for sheer beauty, but easily capable of a decade of aging.\",\n",
       " 'This solid, mainstream Zinfandel displays blackberry fruit and some creamy notes on the nose. Well-defined, dark berry flavors with white pepper and leather accents mark the palate. The mouthfeel is even and the finish here is brisk, tart and juicy. A touch less oak might let the fruit shine a bit more.',\n",
       " \"Shows the clear, fine color, silky mouthfeel and crisp acidity that characterize a fine, cool-climate Pinot Noir, but I wish the fruit were a little more concentrated. It's fine in cola, red cherry, pomegranate and rhubarb, but the middle is thin and the finish is quick. Drink now.\",\n",
       " 'Extravagantly rich, showcasing ripe, forward flavors of cherries baked into a pie, Dr. Pepper cola and sweet, smoky oak, with all kinds of peppery Indian spices. Bone dry, too, with audacious acidity. Seems at its best now, but give it a good decant.',\n",
       " 'The variety is important in Sicily. In California, just about the only winery producing it is Paoletti. It has made a very dry, tannic and rustically astringent wine, with bitter cherryskin flavors. Drink now.',\n",
       " \"This is mostly Syrah, but has a splash each of Grenache and Petite Sirah as well. It's solid and generous, though less compelling than either the Merlot or the Cabernet from Milbrandt. Strong vanilla and tobacco flavors overtake the fruit, and the earthy tannins lack focus, but it's fair value.\",\n",
       " 'Bracing and tangy, this light-bodied wine has distinct melon aromas, similar flavors and tasty accents of white pepper and fresh fennel. While nicely reserved it also has complexity and great balance.',\n",
       " \"Good price for a Pinot of this quality. It's dry and silky in the mouth, with classic Pinot flavors of cherries, spices and cola, enriched with smoky oak.\",\n",
       " 'Tropical fruit aromas mingle with toasted oak on the nose of this elegant wine from Finger Lakes pioneer Dr. Frank. On the palate, the wine offers appealing and balanced flavors of creamy vanilla, spice and vibrant, lively fruit, making it an excellent choice for everything from salmon to spicier Asian cuisine.',\n",
       " \"Here's a big, extravagant, unctuous Chard that leaves little to the imagination. Everything's oversized and upfront: the massive tropical fruit and spice flavors, the toasty, caramelized oak, the creamy, leesy texture, the finish. It's flashy, but seems to pall after a few sips.\",\n",
       " \"The Dobles Lías has more lees contact than Marimar's other Chardonnays, giving it a rich, yeasty creaminess. There's also plenty of new French oak influence. Made from estate-grown fruit, it's rich with papayas, tangerines and guavas. It's delicious now, but has all the structure a Chardonnay needs to negotiate the next eight years.\",\n",
       " 'With sweet, jammy apricot, pear and pineapple flavors, this Sémillon is a little simple and direct. It has crisp acidity that provides needed balance to all that fruit.',\n",
       " 'A beautiful Viognier, if you like those rich, exotic flavors the variety offers. Firmed up with crisp, coastal acidity and fully dry, its flavors range from Meyer lemons, Key lime pie and pineapples to honeysuckle flowers, vanilla and apricots.',\n",
       " 'This is quite an interesting wine, and it just shows how a little creative blending can lift an ordinary wine up. The dominant Sauvignon Blanc brings the usual citrus and grassy acidity, while 8% of Viognier adds flowery perfume, and 10% Verdelho brings more acidity and a lemongrass, green apple edge. Terrific, versatile food wine.',\n",
       " 'This attractive wine opens with a nicely nuanced bouquet of berry, spice and earth accented by positive gamy and slightly barnyardy notes. The textured palate offers attractive dark fruit and a touch of tar and licorice. Ends with an even, dry, long finish of pepper, earth and leather.',\n",
       " \"This new bottling from Saxum is nearly all Syrah, with a splash of Grenache. In youth, it's dark and somewhat brooding, rich in tannins. But acidity is low, and the tannins are of the ripely sweet modern kind, so the wine is immediately drinkable. Immense in blackberry, cassis, mocha and dusty Asian spices, it's gorgeously rich and decadent.\",\n",
       " \"The cool vintage in this cool region has yielded a wine with grapefruit, lime and wildflower. There's no oak, so the fruit is front and center, along with vibrant acidity.\",\n",
       " 'A perfect evocation of how beautifully Sauvignon Blanc expresses itself in the Happy Canyon area of the Santa Ynez Valley. With no oak, and without the malolactic fermentation, what you get is pure fruit. Crisp, mouthwatering acidity frames beautiful flavors of Meyer lemons, limes, peaches, minerals and, yes, gooseberries. What a wonderful food wine.',\n",
       " \"The vineyard is up in the Mayacamas between Spring Mountain and Sonoma Valley, and the wine shows quite a bit of power. Coming from this hot vintage, it's also very ripe and fruity, in a California way. But it's classically structured and dry, and the tannins are softly complex. This delicious, ageable Cab is a worthy followup to the '03.\",\n",
       " 'Aromatic and full-bodied, this memorable white offers classic lychee, grapefruit and citrus aromas, followed by a slightly sweet mingling of tropical fruit and spice flavors. Balanced by minerality and acid, the wine finishes clean and elegantly. Another win for Dr. Frank.',\n",
       " \"It's all about fruit and softness in this Syrah, which has a little Mourvèdre, Grenache and Petit Verdot, of all things. Floods the mouth with intense blackberry, black cherry, cappuccino, milk chocolate, spicy vanilla and white pepper flavors, with just enough of a tannic edge for palate-stimulating balance.\",\n",
       " \"This pure Marsanne was whole-cluster pressed and fermented in French oak barrels—30% of which were new. It's full and flavorful, and it has a lemony richness that's streaked with veins of butterscotch and marzipan. As with all of this winery's 2011 white wines, the aromatics are excellent and the length is exceptional.\",\n",
       " 'A compact wine, with more than a trace of sweaty saddle, along with red currant, herbs and spice. Depending upon your liking for barnyard notes, this could warrant a higher score.',\n",
       " \"Argyle's reserve shows more barrel flavor than the regular Willamette Valley bottling, highlighting an interesting mix of Asian spice and coffee. But the tannins are oddly absent; there seems to be a bit of a hole in the back of the wine. It opens beautifully, then hits a dead spot. A good wine, but missing something.\",\n",
       " \"A very oaky nose leads into a tough, tannic wine. There's good fruit under all the wood and tannin, and the tight, rugged finish should smooth out in time.\",\n",
       " 'Sharp in acidity and jammy in cherry-raspberry fruit, with a spicy coat of smoky oak, this young Pinot Noir is just too tough for immediate enjoyment. This is a wine with a reputation for ageability. It will probably blossom after 2013. If you drink it now, give it a good decant.',\n",
       " \"Rich and soft, this Pinot seems like it's coming to the end of its useful life. It's fully dry, with cherry, berry, cola and spice flavors that are starting to turn mushroomy. Drink now.\",\n",
       " 'Direct and easygoing, this Zinfandel tastes of blackberry, bacon, clove and pepper. The oak is tame, and the wine is ready to drink.',\n",
       " 'Shows good character in the dryness, crispness, smooth tannins and silky texture that frame ripe cherry pulp, cola, vanilla and pepper flavors. On the minus side is a sharply acidic finish. Drink soon.',\n",
       " 'This wine has very intense vegetal, stemmy aromas and flavors. It was aged entirely in stainless steel.',\n",
       " 'The Stonetree bottling (one of three single-vineyard Zins from Angel Vine) offers pure strawberry fruit flavor, with medium concentration. The 15.2% alcohol does not show that scale, but does offer some finishing power. Could it develop more density and depth with another year in the bottle? Time will tell.',\n",
       " \"Luscious, long, full-bodied and rich, a wonderful wine that showcases its appellation. Has well-ripened flavors of blackcurrants and cassis that drink long and deep, although there's some hollowness, which costs it a few points. The flavors are wrapped in soft, easy but complex tannins. Fully dry and nicely oaked, this wine is immediately enjoyable.\",\n",
       " \"This is the winery's sweet bubbly, and it will appeal to fans of sweet wines. The orange, vanilla and honeysuckle flavors are delicious and easy. The blend is Flora, Gewürztraminer and Pinot Noir.\",\n",
       " \"Tasted beside the wonderful 2006, this Bordeaux blend is considerably more tannic and aloof. Almost equal parts Merlot and Cabernet Franc, it's very deeply flavored in black and red currants, licorice and dusty Asian spices, while lots of new French oak adds a sturdy framework. Seems an obvious candidate for the cellar, and should blossom after 2011.\",\n",
       " 'Blended with 20% Zinfandel, this Sangiovese is dry, acidic and somewhat harsh in the mouth. It has cherry, raspberry, tobacco and herb flavors that finish a little medicinal.',\n",
       " 'If you smelled this blind you might think it was Sauvignon Blanc. But swirl it, let it breathe, and the rosehip tea comes along. In the mouth, the wine is crisp  with tea, cherry skin and root beer flavors.',\n",
       " 'The Derby is pure, estate-grown, 100% Cabernet Sauvignon. The nose is accented with hints of violets and roses, ripe berries, plums and licorice. Once tasted, it seems to hit a wall and just stop. Extra hours of breathing did not make a difference. Perhaps it needs more bottle age, but at the moment it does not broaden out or move into a finish with the sort of depth that this wine has demonstrated in the past.',\n",
       " \"Easton's small-production Barbera is tight, showcasing its mountain-grown fruit, and quite savory and leathery in style. With a backbone of blacker fruit than Cooper Ranch, it's earthy and ready for mushroom-laden pasta dishes or risotto.\",\n",
       " \"Although this is silky and elegant, it is one of Siduri's higher alcohol Pinot Noirs. Ripe and impressive, the raspberry and cherry pie flavors are accented by sweet, smoky oak notes. Drink it over the next 2–3 years for sheer pleasure.\",\n",
       " \"Dark, ripe and tannic, it's an ager, but there's something about it now that's instantly appealing. It is a dry wine but with a honeyed sweetness and glyceriney richness. Oozes blackberry, lead pencil, currant, cedar and mocha flavors leading to a long, balanced finish.\",\n",
       " \"This is a huge Cabernet, very soft in the modern manner, and very ripe. It's a blast of cherry jam and milk chocolate, with plenty of toasty oak, and the tannins are firm and complex. Good now, it should hold well for the next ten years.\",\n",
       " 'A delicious sparkler; shows the delicacy and elegance of a blanc de blancs at its California best. The Chardonnay contributes subtle peach and citrus   flavors, and the mousse, or bubbly mouthfeel, is very refined. Should age well. Drink now–2009, at least.',\n",
       " 'Feels rustic in the rough but ready tannins and slightly sweet, jammy cherry and cola flavors that are accented with smoky sandalwood. Not going anywhere, so drink up.',\n",

A blend of Grenache, Mourvedre, Syrah and Counoise, it's a dry, rich, full-bodied red wine, flooded with easy-to-drink cherry, blackberry, blueberry and oak flavors, and a wealth of Provençal rosemary, lavender and thyme. Drink now for its soft, youthful purity.\",\n",
       " \"Testarossa is one of the few wineries to make a statewide bottling that's more expensive than their vineyard-designated ones. In this case, the wine is indisputably delicious.

Drink now through 2013.\",\n",
       " \"This wine is still young and precocious, but don't judge it too quickly. Let it air in your glass, and watch how it changes. One minute it's all cherries and smoke; the next it heaves up a great draught of currants, cocoa and cedar. It's a big wine but deceptive; the tannins are airy and lilting, there's charm and underneath, enormous complexity. It's best left alone for a few more years, but it's really very lovely now.\",\n",
       " \"The pleasant nose of nuts, green apples and caramel also shows an odd whiff that mattered more to some tasters than others. Light apple fruit, spice, earth and butterscotch notes play on the full, but vaguely sour milk-tinged palate. Finishes tart and dry with slight mineral notes, in the manner of some white Burgundies. We've been big fans of Foxen's wines in the past, but this one left us scratching our heads.\",\n",
       " 'This bright and fruity take on the southern Rhône grape is packed with fresh, tangy raspberry flavor, tight and balanced.',\n",
       " \"A spectacular Pinot, continuing a string of great vintages from this little vineyard. The year 2007 gave California supernaturally rich but balanced Pinot Noirs, and this is one of them. It's sensational, offering broad, exotic fruit flavors, pinpointed with exotic spices, and exquisitely highlighted with French oak. Truly fine, this small-production wine should age over the next 6–8 years.\",\n",
       " \"This high-end Cab is named after a deceased winery employee who would be pleased to have such a distinguished wine in his memory.

       " \"Some of Seghesio's plantings are over a century old, and the wine has a classic, briary quality to it. Supple and inviting, it drinks well now but has the balance and structure to age for a few years.\",\n",
       " 'This is a very fruity, dynamic Zin with concentrated cherry, raspberry, blackberry and cola flavors, generously spiced. It has the dryness and tannic structure you want in a nice Zin, with a touch of oak.',\n",
       " 'The star of the show among the three Libra wines tasted, this biodynamically-farmed offering is dark and exotic, with a range of scents from cherry liqueur to cinnamon, anise, and flowers. It breathes open into a perfumed and spicy wine, with accents of orange peel around substantial, brambly fruit.',\n",
       " 'A whiff of tomato opens the wine, which moves into a light cherry core with a hint of brine. The middle quickly finds a conclusion, and the tannins are authoritative and chewy.',\n",
       " 'How astonishing to find an Oregon Pinot Noir just under 13% alcohol that is fully ripe and fragrant with a perfect balance of fruit, herb and mineral. The young raspberry fruit flavors and overall lightness of this wine match beautifully with lox or smoked salmon. Despite its elegance, this strikes me as a wine that could turn out to be quite long-lived, given its impeccable balance.',\n",
       " \"The alcohol on this bottling is lower than most Fe Ciegas have been in the past, reflecting the cool vintage. The wine seems more austere than in the past, withholding a bit of the early appeal it used to show. Nonetheless, it's wonderfully structured in acids and tannins and very dry, with a judicious application of oak, and there are intricate flavors of cherries, red currants and herbs. Seems like it could shine with age, so give it six years in the cellar.\",\n",
       " \"This Syrah is so good, it makes you wonder if the Chalone appellation isn't more Rhône than Burgundy. The vines were incredibly low-yielding, giving only 1.2 tons to the acre, and the flavors are intensely concentrated in cassis, black cherry, blueberry jam and vanilla mocha. Soft and gentle, the wine seems best now for its voluptuous fruit.\",\n",
       " 'A blend of Sangiovese, Syrah and Cabernet Sauvignon, this pricey red wine is super-fruity and pretty direct. It offers lots of blackberries, cherries, currants, mocha and spices, wrapped into sturdy tannins, and is bone dry.',\n",
       " \"This Zin is so fresh and jammy in raspberries, cherries and blackberries, you wonder why they didn't hold it back for a while, to let the flavors meld. Tasted in March 2008, it still had that acid-forward, crushed berry tartness you find in wine straight out of the fermenter. But it's a very good Zin that will improve in the bottle. This should be at its best by this winter and into 2009.\",\n",
       " \"Babcock's Fathom seriously needs heat to ripen, and 2006 just didn't offer enough warmth. As a result, this Merlot and Petit Verdot blend has a stubbornly green, minty streak. It's very dry, with some good chocolate-  covered cherry candy flavors, but that tartness detracts.\",\n",
       " \"This southern Rhône-style blend is full-bodied and fruit-forward. The beautiful ripe fruit is a jumble of red berries and plums. Barrel aging introduces streaks of coffee and toast, with the vineyard's natural herb and mineral elements adding subtle details.\",\n",
       " \"You'll find it difficult to keep your hands off this gem, a block selection from the estate vineyard. The name, notes the winery, comes from an ancient Greek dance. Dark, smoky and toasty, this gripping wine is tight-knit and packed with raspberry and black cherry fruit, set against sweet baking spices. The balance is perfect, and this will drink well now through 2030.\",\n",
       " \"Big, rich, extracted and just beautiful. It's a high-octane Zin, with high alcohol and ripe, spicy flavors, making it a classic example of its type. Just massive in blackberries, black cherries, beef teriaki, cola, pepper, Indian spices and sandalwood. Drink this decadently good wine from now–2013.\",\n",
       " 'With a dusty core of black plum, cassis and clove, this is a straightforward, softly approachable wine made to be enjoyed now. Medium bodied, it enters into a realm of creamy vanilla on the finish.',\n",
       " \"Plenty of Zinny character in this lusty, spicy young wine. It shows how well Zin ripens in a good Napa vineyard. With firm, supporting tannins, it's bone dry and rich in wild berry, pepper, bacon and cinnamon spice flavors, with just a hint of raisining in the finish.\",\n",
       " \"A noble red wine, based on the finely ground tannins and superb integration of fruit and oak. There's a purity to the complex waves of blackberries, currants, Canadian bacon, dried herbs, black pepper and sandalwood, with a minerally tang that must come from the soil. Wonderful now, this great Syrah should develop additional bottle nuances over the next six years.\",\n",
       " \"The heat during harvest was just horrible, and seems to have impacted this Grenache-Mourvèdre blend. This has never been Foxen's premier red wine anyway; the previous vintage was good, but not great. This year, there's just too much heat.\",\n",
       " \"This is a very high-class Cabernet. You can tell from the sumptuous tannins and the overall balance and elegance. It's soft and gentle enough to drink now, with voluptuous waves of blackberries, black currants, anise, chocolate and cedar, yet shows a density that suggests midterm ageability through 2015 or so.\",\n",
       " 'Easy and dry, this blend of too many varieties to name has raspberry, rosehip tea, floral and wild herb flavors. The addition of Sauvignon Blanc seems to bring a refreshing citrus element.',\n",
       " \"Crisp and fine in coastal acidity, with bright flavors of pineapples, ripe pears and green apples, this would be a good Chardonnay, except for one thing. It's too sweet.\",\n",
       " \"Aged partially in old oak barrels, there's a distinctly savory, spicy tone to pressed apple and pear aromas on this reserve Riesling. Light-bodied and off-dry in style, the palate boasts honeyed apple flavors cut by a zesty streak of lemon-lime acidity. Lifted floral tones lift the finish.\",\n",
       " 'A solid brut from Mumm Napa, this Pinot-Chardonnay blend is a little rough around the edges, but has the dry, bubbly finesse of a true Champagne-style wine. It shows peach, lime and strawberry flavors.',\n",
       " 'A heavy, acidic and boring wine, not offering much in the way of flavor except for some bitter cherries.',\n",
       " \"Le Cadeau's Equinoxe Cuvée is the winery's most limited offering, just 110 cases. Quite distinctive, it carries a high, piercing caraway note, but also offers rich, ripe, chunky cherry fruit and streaks of cola and caramel. It's concentrated and chewy, a substantial wine with a soft, lengthy finish incorporating earth, leaf and pepper.\",\n",
       " 'Pretty direct now, offering blackberry, black currant, cola and oak flavors. The tannins are firm, the acids brisk. Feels rich and consistent. Could develop bottle nuance in the cellar over the next 6–8 years.',\n",
       " \"There's a whiff of volatile, hot fermentation aromas that overlie black cherry and smoky tar. In the mouth this is a chewy, earthy, smoky Cabernet, suitable for outdoor dining and grilled meats. The tannins are still showing a little green edge, but some extra breathing softens them up.\",\n",
       " \"Sometimes it seems that our white wine industry could become a Chardonnay monoculture. It's good to see that Fetzer isn't abandoning their efforts with other varietals. Sweet peach, mild lychee and spice aromas open this unabashedly sweet and easy wine, with its tangerine flavors and slight spritz on the round palate. Not very complex or sophisticated, but broadly appealing\",\n",
       " 'A lush, approachable wine that features cherry and tobacco aromas and flavors.  Tart acidity spices up the softly tannic finish, giving it a lively feel that would pair well with a variety of foods',\n",
       " \"A beautiful southern Rhône-style wine, based on Syrah but with additions of Mourvèdre and Grenache. It's dry, fulled-bodied and tannic, with meaty, leathery flavors of blackberries and cassis. Feels very rich and dense, and should develop for the next 4–5 years.\",\n",
       " 'Massively fruity and oaky, this is an atom bomb of a Chardonnay. You either love this style or you hate it. The pineapple tart, apricot, pear, peach, crème brûlée, buttered toast, vanilla cream and cinnamon spice flavors go on and on. Beyond the utter richness is firm acidity and a bracing minerality. Defines California-style decadence, but drink now, as the wine will quickly go downhill.',\n",
       " \"Co-released with Curtis's Best Buy Heritage Cuvée, this wine, a blend of Grenache and Syrah, is very similar in its dry construction and forward fruit. Yet it's a little more tannic, and the oak seems more prominent. The flavors explode with cherries, blackberries, pomegranates, plums and mocha.\",\n",
       " \"A robust, spicy wine that offers lots of bang for the buck. The flavors range from lush raspberries and red cherries up through blackberries and currants, veering into mocha, and there's lots of crushed black pepper. Easy to like with steak, lamb, Mexican food.\",\n",
       " 'This lush, intricate and complex Pinot Noir really brings out the best of Russian River Valley. The fruit is enormously ripe, suggesting mashed cherries, blackberry jam, red licorice, cola and peppery spices, and the tannin-acid structure is just about perfect. The texture is right down the middle between silky-light and full-bodied. Beautiful now and through 2012.',\n",
       " 'Marked by acidity and grapeskin bitterness, this is a Pinot Noir to stash in the cellar, in order to let everything resolve. It shows fresh, vibrant flavors of cherries, raspberries and red currants, and is very dry. Should hit its window of opportunity between 2010–2012.',\n",
       " 'Yet another outstanding effort from Rulo, this  appealing Chardonnay marries pretty peach flavors to a mix of spices from 100% French oak barrel fermentation. Cinnamon and other Asian spices, along with barrel toast, provide a nice counterpoint to the ripe fruit.',\n",
       " \"Kind of clunky now. Bigtime tannins make it astringent, and the fruit flavors, of blackberries and sour cherry candy coated with oak, feel ripely heavy on the palate. Yet it's a clean wine, and could surprise down the road. Try after 2012.\",\n",
       " \"This opens with tart, tight leaf and beetroot flavors, which overlay quite soft, round and riper fruit. The integration of earthy tannins with the fruit is a little disjointed; what shows most clearly are the leafy, herbal plant flavors. There's plenty of stuffing here; perhaps this is one of those wines that will warrant a higher score with additional bottle age.\",\n",
       " 'Shows how ripe red wines get in the Temecula area, with juicy blackberry, cherry, cola, licorice, sweet cured tobacco and cinnamon spice flavors. The tannins are smooth and refined. Finishes a little on the sweet, candied side.',\n",
       " \"Not as successful as the winery's other reds, this seems overloaded with vanilla scents and flavors. The oak overpowers the light fruit, and the tannins – again quite dry – are not set off against anything ripe and sweet to counterbalance their bitterness.\",\n",
       " \"Malbec has been a shining star at this winery, but this bottling is the best yet. Estate grown, big and fruity, this wine is generously soaked in barrel flavors of spice and toast, cocoa and Bourbon. Lush and juicy, the fruit more than holds its own, and it's nearly irresistible.\",\n",
       " \"This Cab-based Bordeaux blend has sizable amounts of Merlot and Cab Franc. It's quite a distinguished wine, classic in the modern Napa sense of softness and ripeness to the point of decadent drinkability. There's a sweet olive-tapenade edge to the blackberry, cassis and cherry flavors. The finish, believe it or not, suggests blueberry pie, fresh from the oven.\",\n",
       " \"A spectacular Pinot Noir, but a very young one, and extremely dry. It's a wine of great structure, with rich acids and tannins framing extraordinarily complex flavors of grilled cherries, strawberries and raspberries, with complicating notes of cola, pomegranates, orange zest, anise, dusty Asian spices and smoky sandalwood. A truly great Pinot Noir from a great vintage that needs time in the bottle to express itself. The vineyard, which is owned by the winery, is only 19 acres, planted to an array of newer and older clones. Best after 2013, if you can keep your hands off.\",\n",
       " \"The delicate nose on this reserve Chard offers citrus and flowers with a touch of nutty spice. On the palate, it's a straightforward white with elements of lemon citrus, grapefruit and hazelnut. An easy-drinking Chardonnay with class.\",\n",
       " 'A semisweet wine, with apricot jam and citrus flavors, offset by crisp acidity. Turns cloying after a few sips.',\n",
       " 'Shows all the hallmarks of great Mondavi Reserve. Ageworthy and complex, with enormously ripe, rich fruit, classic chocolate, cassis plus cream and spice from new oak. So smoothly voluptuous now, it goes down like velvet, but the tannin-acid balance will easily hold this wine through 2015.',\n",
       " \"This Viognier is easily Maison Bleue's best yet, and it sets a high standard for every Viognier in the state. It's superrich and concentrated without being fat, jammy, bitter or hot. The explosion of citrus, stone fruit and light tropical fruit flavors seems to extend indefinitely on the finish. Details of mineral, baking spice and honeysuckle add interest.\",\n",
       " 'This Bordeaux blend offers a bouquet of cassis fruit with earth, tobacco and slight herbaceous flavors with a licorice note on the palate flow to an elegant, tart black-cherry, pepper and earth-tinged finish.  Drinkable now, but still taut, it should develop well over the next three to five years.',\n",
       " \"Yes it is 100% Gewürztraminer, and yes the winery calls it Port, listing the alcohol content at 19.5%. Unusual it certainly may be, but it is really quite well made, with varietal character showcasing very tasty candied citrus and sugared rose petals. The brandy is neither hot nor intrusive. All in all it's an intriguing, versatile and unique dessert wine.\",\n",
       " 'This sugary sweet wine will be enjoyed by lots of people who like this style of Chardonnay. It has rich flavors of pineapples, oranges and vanilla.',\n",
       " \"Dry, tannic and jammy, this Bordeaux blend contains a splash of Syrah. It's strong and flavorful in blackberries, cherries and raspberries, with a rich coating of sweet, smoky oak.\",\n",
       " \"Here's a young Cabernet that's rich in complex, sweet tannins. The fruit shows all the hallmarks of the vintage, wonderfully ripe in blackberry, cherry, blueberry and chocolate flavors with an extravagant coating of toasty new oak. It's awfully good now, and should be opened by 2010 or so because of the softness.\",\n",
       " \"Sound and dry, but heavy and dull, and not quite ripe. There's a vegetal component to the blackberries and oak.\",\n",
       " 'Impresses for the sheer power of ripeness, but also and especially for the structure. The flavors of blackberries, cherries, currants, cocoa, herbs and sweetly smoked oak are beautiful and complex, yet the tannin-acid balance is near perfect. This single-vineyard wine is one of the finest Sonoma County Cabernets of the vintage. Should age effortlessly through 2014, growing purer and more elegant.',\n",
       " 'Like a Beaujolais Nouveau, this is a lively, grapey wine, with fresh-from-the-fermenter flavors of raspberries, red cherries, cinnamon and pepper.',\n",
       " \"Yes, that is the correct spelling, as shown on the wine's label. A blend of 10% Merlot, 56% Syrah, and 34% Cabernet Sauvignon, this is dark, plum-colored and dusty with scents of plum and prune. Soft and moving quickly into midlife, it drinks like an older wine, with soft tannins and a hint of supple leather.\",\n",
       " \"This bubbly is rich in cherry and raspberry fruit, in addition to the usual sparkling wine notes of bread dough and smoke. It's a little sweet and scoury on the palate, but a fairly polished sparkler for this price.\",\n",
       " 'Pretty run of the mill, a tannic Cab with flavors of herbs and berries. Fulfills the basic requirements of dryness and full-bodied balance. Drink now.',\n",
       " 'Simple and sweet, with cola and cherry cough medicine flavors. The sugary taste reprises on the finish.',\n",
       " \"Sweetly ripe, this Syrah offers attractive flavors of blackberry and cherry preserves, mocha, anise, pepper and sweet vanilla and caramel, wrapped into rich, fine tannins. It's a lovely Syrah to drink now.\",\n",
       " \"A very nice Cabernet showing polish and elegance and real Napa structure. Raymond's signature understanding of Cabernet shows in the ripe, dry flavors of black currants, cherries and herbs. Drink now.\",\n",
       " \"A darker, quite savory expression of Black Kite's entire vineyard site in the Deep End of Anderson Valley, this Pinot imparts a touch of cardamom spice and high acidity, with a dryness to the finish that gets a lift from that acid at the end.\",\n",
       " \"A vastly concentrated Cabernet. Frazier seems to have taken their basic Cabernet, which is an excellent wine, and intensified everything about it. With explosive blackberry, cassis, blueberry, dark chocolate and oak flavors, it's almost too much of a good thing. Your best bet is to cellar it, but that's chancy. The alcohol is very high, and we do not know how these modern Cabernets will ride out the years.\",\n",
       " 'Soft and simple, with flavors of melted blackberry, blueberry and raspberry jam, sprinkled with cocoa. Finishes sweet. Syrah, Cabernet Sauvignon.',\n",
       " \"This is one of the richer Rhône-style reds coming out of Paso Robles. It's potent in blackberry and cherry pie filling, blueberry, anise, dark chocolate and smoky cedar flavors. The richness is balanced with fine, silky tannins. Best now–2013.\",\n",
       " 'A little too sweet, with a candied taste of sugared cherries, blackberries and cola, and a dash of caramel. Other than that the tannins are very fine.',\n",
       " 'Lots of razzle-dazzle in this rich, opulent Chardonnay. Shows buttery, oak-inspired pear and pineapple flavors, with a leesy, creamy mouthfeel, and fine acidity to brighten and balance all that richness. Drink this decadent wine with lobster, scallops, crab or shrimp, or a great ahi tuna tartare with potato chips.',\n",
       " 'A concentrated burst of raspberry liqueur comes with a side order of prune and plenty of smoky charcoal. Mouth-filling and tannic, this Cabernet-based blend is built for near-term enjoyment.',\n",
       " \"This wine is made by UC-Santa Cruz astrophysics professor Joe Miller, who's taught wine appreciation for years. Regal and wondrous, the nose conveys concentrated lavender, violets, cedar, oregano, rose petals and patchouli spicing up a grapy frame. The palate offers red fruits laced with clove spice and earth. Ginger, rose water and raspberry emerge in the midpalate, with just enough acidity to carry it through.\",\n",
       " \"A good, dry Pinot that's a little common and gritty, but finely constructed. It has firm acids and tannins and flavors of sour cherry candy, tobacco and cedar. Drink now.\",\n",
       " \"Nearing four years of age, this Pinot remains tannic and tight. It's dark, full-bodied and rich in cherries and currants, and quite dry. But it flirts with overripeness, which detracts from the wine's delicacy. Ready to drink now.\",\n",
       " 'Powerful yet restrained, this wine beautifully expresses the delicate and nuanced aspects of Cabernet Sauvignon with the herbal side of the grape in full force. Everything is tied together in a neat and tidy bundle, with sweet blackberry fruit surrounded by leaf and earth, leading into ripe but stiff tannins and just the right elements of mocha toast. Will it age? Undoubtedly; but hard not to drink it right now.',\n",
       " \"This offers pleasant, lightly spicy flavors of Asian pear, crisp apple and even a hint of citrus. It does not have the concentration of the 2005 version, but it's a delightful bottle, perfect for summer sipping.\",\n",
       " 'A single vineyard, 100% varietal Cabernet Sauvignon, this is deep, dark, dense, chewy and tannic. Yet it still captures some delicate floral aromas as well as smoke and rock and black fruits. You go from flower to fruit to earth and black olive in a rush of full-bodied flavor.',\n",
       " 'A vineyard blend that includes 16% Petite Sirah, 2% Carignane, 4% Mataro and 1% Alicante Bouschet. Meaty, funky and ripe, with intense fruit, lots of earthy, barnyardy accents, and a long, tannic finish. This is old style Zin, no holds barred, with full-throttle flavors for aficionados.',\n",
       " 'A blended white, but predominantly—you guessed it—Chardonnay. The soft, sweet pear aromas and flavors are simple and clean, making this a decent quaffer on a hot summer day.',\n",
       " \"This verges on dilute flavors with alcohol not quite reaching 12%. Light scents of plum and sassafras continue with accents of lime and mineral. Try this with light fare that won't overwhelm the flavors.\",\n",
       " 'Notable for its richness and concentration of fruit, and also for the finesse of the tannin structure. Feels softly lush and luxurious, with potent blackberry and cherry-pie filling, raspberry liqueur, dark chocolate and smoky sandalwood flavors. Needs time to resolve its elements. Give it 5–6 years in a good cellar.',\n",
       " 'A bit harsh and rustic in the mouth, with a hot pepper and sandpaper roughness that detracts. Needs rich beef dishes to balance out its tannins.',\n",
       " 'Tough and gritty, lacking the opulent charm you want in a good Merlot. The flavors suggest briary cherries, blackberries and spices, with an elaborate coating of oak. Drink now.',\n",
       " 'Somewhat raisiny and bitter. Tastes like press wine, with harsh, grapeskin tannins that make it feel astringently dry. Pretty good flavors, though, of blackberries and currants. Drink up.',\n",
       " \"Charles Krug's Limited Release program sets a new level of quality for this Napa stalwart. This Cabernet Sauvignon boasts plenty of smoky oak on the nose, but also bold cassis fruit and hints of vanilla and tobacco. This is fuler and richer than either the Syrah or the Cab Franc, with soft but plentiful tannins that would make this a solid steakhouse choice over the next 10 years.\",\n",
       " \"Made without oak, although the wine has a tart leanness that would have benefited from a little barrel exposure. Nonetheless, it's dry and crisp and minerally, with modest pineapple, Meyer lemon and flower flavors.\",\n",
       " \"Extraordinarily rich and ripe, this unique Cabernet-based blend contains 30% Syrah. It's a dramatic wine, marked by a near-perfect tannin structure and massive, long-lasting flavors of blackberries, black currants, chocolate, licorice, candied violets, sweet leather, peppery spices and smoky sandalwood. Marked by youthful primary fruit now, it needs time to knit together. Give it until after 2012 to come around, and should develop for many years after.\",\n",
       " 'A blend of various Loring vineyards, this wine is soft and flamboyant in fruity flavor, and a little sweet in the finish, with dramatically ripe black cherry, chocolate and coffee flavors encased in soft, velvety but complex tannins. It defines the modern style of cool-climate California Pinot Noir allowed to achieve maximum ripeness.',\n",
       " \"This is a very rich, ripe, flamboyant Pinot, made in the lush California style. It's flashy in complex tiers of raspberries, cherries, red currants, licorice, cocoa and cinnamon spice, yet is silky and dry. The fruit comes from Sonoma Coast, Green Valley and the Middle Reach. An impressive followup to the inaugural '07, and a bottling to watch.\",\n",
       " \"Primarily '08 Merlot, Syrah, and Cab Franc with some '07 Cab Sauv also. Once again this wine rocks; it has fruit power, punch and presence. The flavors mingle seamlessly, young fruit with an attitude. Spicy, highlighted berry and plum flavors, with baking spice details, and some finishing heat.\",\n",
       " \"This Bordeaux blend has some sharp edges. It's slightly unripe, with green wintergreen notes that lend a tartness to the blackberry and smoky oak flavors. Doesn't seem likely to improve in the bottle.\",\n",
       " 'This blend of Mourvèdre and Counoise is soft and sweet. It tastes like the wine version of a milk-chocolate candy bar, infused with blackberry essence and alcohol.',\n",
       " \"Here's a very dry, steely and streamlined Chardonnay. Brims with mineral-infused pineapple tart, buttered toast and honey flavors. Feels wonderfully elegant and balanced, and will pair beautifully with barbecued salmon. The vineyard is located on the so-called Santa Maria bench, one of the region's prime growing areas.\",\n",
       " \"True to Amador's brawnier style, this Zin is still tightly tannic but shows ripe black cherry and blackberry flavor with plenty of dark chocolate and cocoa powder. Made from old-vine, sustainably grown grapes, it's priced fairly and should open with age. Pair with a thick piece of meat.\",\n",
       " 'Well done with the leafy green, lightly peppery character of the grape. Good balance and persistence, with tannins that finish with green tea flavors.',\n",
       " \"Rich, concentrated, and loaded with smoky, dark, spicy fruit flavors, this is a full-on Bordeaux blend, with Cabernet Franc, Merlot and Petit Verdot. There's plenty of barrel influence, from 70% new French oak, but it's welcome, and appropriate, perfectly matched to the power of the fruit. An underlayer of woodsy earth and mushroom adds further complexity.\",\n",
       " 'Sourced from a mix of vineyards in the Horse Heaven Hills AVA, this dark, tannic, earthy wine has a dry, astringent mouthfeel. Cassis and black fruits are matched by a strong herbal element, and the quick finish suggests young vines.',\n",
       " \"Dark in color and viscous in texture, this wine shows dried plum, concentrated blueberry, cola, licorice and kirsch on the nose. It's powerfully flavored on the palate, with cooked cherry and mulberry fruit, as well as vanilla and ginger spice. It will be exciting to see what the new winemaking and ownership team does with this iconic estate.\",\n",
       " 'Intensely aromatic with notes of orange blossom, honeysuckle and candied orange peel, this balances ripe tropical fruit and creamy butterscotch flavors with a shower of lemonade acidity. Made using grapes that were frozen post-harvest.',\n",
       " 'Smells fresh and invigorating, but in the mouth it has raisiny flavors. This is a young Pinot, rich in acids and tannins, but that overripe quality limits ageability and makes the wine a bit one-dimensional. Drink now.',\n",
       " 'This very rich, ripe and forward Pinot Noir can be opened now for its vast array of raspberries, cherries, cola, red licorice and smoky sandalwood. It grows more interesting as it warms in the glass, showing facets of pomegranates and violets. Will provide good drinking through 2014.',\n",
       " \"Crème brûlée and baked apple aromas on the nose open to a smooth palate of mild apple, pineapple and spice flavors with citrus accents.The flavors aren't vibrant, though, and the intensity of the oak rendered the faint fruit nearly invisible.\",\n",
       " \"Good for the price. It's rich and oaky, with lots of jammy fruit, cassis, vanilla, toast and spice flavors. With production of more than 14,000 cases, it's easy to find.\",\n",
       " \"This wine uses the same Merlot and Cabernet Franc as the superpremium Sorella (due out in the spring), but here the Cab is a younger Champoux block, planted in 1990. Though a blend of 55% Cabernet Sauvignon, 21% Cabernet Franc, 15% Merlot and the rest Petit Verdot, the wine expresses itself with a captivating purity. The fruit almost seems to shine with glistening flavors of berries. It's a perfectly balanced and beautifully integrated mix of spicy herb, primary fruits, natural acids and compelling density.\",\n",
       " \"A new offering from the country's largest producer of Rieslings, this fits an emerging off-dry category, with 11% alcohol and 4.7% residual sugar. It's a slightly sweeter companion to the winery's popular Columbia Valley bottling, with more of the honey and tea, less of the cool fruit flavors.\",\n",

    "To train our model, we are going to have to convert all of our categorical features (i.e. text) into continuous features (i.e. numbers). This is a very common process that is performed for training Machine Learning models, as features are often categorical in datasets. Machine Learning algorithms work purely with numbers to perform various tasks such as regression (e.g. predicting housing prices when given the square footage and location of a house) and classification (e.g. predicting whether or not a tumor is malignant, given the mass of the tumor). We will convert all of the categorical features except for the description feature, which we will touch on this in a bit."
