Meanwhile, 100% new French oak adds an elaborate layer of smoky caramel and char that's entirely in keeping with the wine's volume. Impressive and flashy, but immature, this wine requires cellaring. Best 2012–2018.\",\n",
       " 'This is quite an interesting wine, and it just shows how a little creative blending can lift an ordinary wine up. The dominant Sauvignon Blanc brings the usual citrus and grassy acidity, while 8% of Viognier adds flowery perfume, and 10% Verdelho brings more acidity and a lemongrass, green apple edge. Terrific, versatile food wine.',\n",
       " \"Mountain fruit is the key to understanding this 100% Cab. By that is meant a unique combination of firm, astringent tannins and fabulously concentrated blackberry and currant fruit that absolutely demands aging. It's obvious that the terroir these grapes come from needs an appellation other than Alexander Valley, for there's nothing soft or herbal going on here. Hold until 2010, then should develop through 2014, at least.\",\n",
       " \"The Jack is Saviah's everyday successful red blend, and accounts for half of the winery's 7,000 case production. This is sweet and bursting with ripe red fruit flavors of strawberry preserves, raspberries and peaches. It hits some hard tannins but the pretty fruit keeps on going.\",\n",
       " 'One of the best values in high-end Oregon Chardonnay, this new release packs a wallop. ?Although just 15% of the French oak was new, the wine is loaded with toasty, buttery scents and flavors. Let it breathe and the ripe fruit flavors zoom into focus—candied citrus, apricot and a bit of lemon meringue pie.',\n",
       " 'Pungent and herbal aromas make for a vivid splash upon entry. The wine quickly evolves into pretty cherry fruit, wrapped in cinnamon, sassafras and cocoa, then runs into gently fading barrel spices.',\n",
       " 'From the estate vineyard, this blend of several Dijon clones was fermented with indigenous yeast, 10% whole cluster, cellared a year in one third new French oak, and bottled unfined and unfiltered. Young vines give it youthful cherry and berry flavors, with a lively mouthfeel and highlights of herb, spice and mocha.',\n",
       " 'A good choice for fans of older wines, the Raphael 2002 Merlot shows mature forest floor and earth scents but is still hanging on to some raspberry and blackberry fruit. The crisp palate has a mouthwatering character and a touch of singed plum flavor. Woody tannins chime in on the medium finish. Drink before 2011.',\n",
       " 'Made solidly in the Californian style, a ripe, soft, direct wine that attempts to seduce the palate with big fruit and oak and a velvety smooth mouthfeel. The blackberry jam, cherry cola and toasty flavors are tasty. Drink now.',\n",
       " \"Here's an interesting blend: 71% Zinfandel, 21% Cabernet Sauvignon and the rest a split between Merlot and Cab Franc —all of it Walla Walla Valley fruit. It jumps out with a spicy hit of barrel, a little rough but quickly smothered in cherry-flavored fruit and chocolaty tannins. It's got a little bit of wild herb as well, and it's a crafty mix that never falls back into neutral.\",\n",
       " \"Intense in raspberry, cherry and blackberry flavors that have a chocolaty edge, this wine also has some raisiny tastes suggesting shriveled or superripe berries, but it maintains essential dryness. It's a big, rustic, expressive Zin that calls for similar fare.\",\n",
       " \"Small berries with thick skins give this wine concentration and tannin, making some extra time in bottle mandatory. It's still tight, and the layers of graphite and earth complement without concealing the lighter floral aromas and pretty, wild berry fruit. It rolls into a complex finish with black fruits, cola, licorice and baking chocolate, all lightly applied and in perfect proportion.\",\n",
       " 'Monster aromas leap out of the glass, rich in plum and blackberry fruit, chocolate, spice and caramel. Tastes almost Port-like, with huge fruit flavors, a syrupy texture, slight sweetness, and a bit of heat from 15.5% alcohol.',\n",
       " 'Shows the bright, citrusy acidity and ripe fruit the vineyard is known for. Really quite an exotic Chard, with waves of papaya, persimmon, Meyer lemon, Asian spice, buttercream and vanilla smoke flavors. Should develop well. Drink now–2012.',\n",
       " 'A bit rugged and rustic in the mouth, but dry and very ripe, with chocolate-infused blackberry pie, mushu plum sauce and cedar flavors. The blend is Cab, Zinfandel and Petite Sirah.',\n",
       " \"A bit on the hot side, reflecting the extra warmth that the Pope Valley region of eastern Napa Valley gets during the summer. Made from 100% Cabernet, it's massively flavored, huge in jammy blackberries, cherries, cassis and dark chocolate. The tannins are considerable, the finish long and ripe. Best to open this wine by 2015 or so.\",\n",
       " 'A very fine Pinot Noir that shows the crispness of its Central Coast origins, and also plenty of richness. Offers waves of cherries, red currants, cola and cedar, with a pleasantly stimulating bitterness. Drink this complex, food-friendly wine now and through 2011.',\n",
       " 'One of the best Vista Verde Pinots ever from Williams Selyem. Ripe and delicious, with cherry, raspberry and sandalwood flavors, and a tang of minerals and flowers that come from the vineyard. Feels a little awkward now, so give it 5–6 years in the cellar.',\n",
       " 'Lovely and tart, showing the finesse of this cool-climate vineyard. The flavors are of sour red cherries and cranberries. Tastes so sweet and savory, feels so vigorous and filled with life. Yet the mouthfeel is delicate and uplifted. With no new oak, the wine should develop over the next 8–10 years.',\n",
       " \"Too ripe and simple in jammy pineapples, tangerines and apricots to stimulate interest, and although it's dry, the acidity tastes unnatural. Shows the difficulties of crafting a fine white wine in Paso Robles.\",\n",
       " 'In this cooler vintage the wine is finished at under 13% alcohol—a rarity these days. It is a lovely wine, spiced with pine needle accents over cranberry and raspberry fruit. Acids are full but not biting, and the tannins proportionate. The return of elegance.',\n",
       " 'The vineyard is in the interior part of the appellation, toward Carneros, and the wine displays the firm, acidic minerality of that cool, foggy region. It has fantastic limpidity. The oak is remarkable for the purity of vanilla and smoky honey, while the underlying flavors of Meyer lemons, pineapples, nectarines and kumquats are decadently good. A masterpiece of Chardonnay.',\n",
       " 'Soft and dull, with flavors of blackberries, chocolate, currants, plums and pepper. Lacks structure and vibrancy.',\n",
       " 'Heavy, sweet and super-oaky, like a liquid infusion of buttered popcorn, pineapple jam and vanilla meringue. Will appeal to many, but purists will find it heavy-handed and manipulated.',\n",
       " \"This is the middle tier of Wölffer's Chardonnay offerings, squarely between the top-of-the-line Estate Selection and the entry-level La Ferme Martin label. The Reserve exhibits plenty of buttered-pear flavors, complemented by faint nutty aromas and some toasty oak notes that gain steam on the finish.\",\n",
       " \"From a vineyard in Philo, this shows the grace and elegance of its vineyard's terroir, with crisp, citrusy acids framing remarkably ripe and pure flavors of cherries, raspberries, red plums, gingerbread, vanilla and cinnamon-spice. Completely delicious and complex, it will hold for six years or so.\",\n",
       " \"Though the nose seems dark and brooding with notes of black cherries, smoke and spice, on the palate, this is surprisingly light and fresh with a bright sour cherry acidity and soft tannins. There's a hint of green stems throughout this fairly light bodied wine.\",\n",
       " \"This is a robust Pinot Noir, marked by excessive alcohol that gives it a peppery burn throughout. Beyond that, it's dry and silky, with flavors of very ripe cherry, red currant and Dr. Pepper.\",\n",
       " \"A beautiful young Rutherford Cabernet, showing the dusty elegance and complexity of a top estate. There's a rich herbality to the cherry, cassis and blackberry fruit, suggesting fresh green chervil, sage and thyme. Oak adds harmonious notes of vanilla, cedar and char. The tannins are thick and juvenile, but very finely ground. With 8% Cabernet Franc, this lush wine needs time. Hold until after 2008, and it should improve for another six years, conservatively.\",\n",
       " \"A soft, somewhat one-dimensional wine that doesn't possess the brightness or interest you expect in a Sonoma Coast Pinot Noir. That's despite some very rich cherry, licorice, cola and sandalwood flavors. Drink up.\",\n",
       " 'Baked strawberry and a bittersweet note of cherry play off the palate around a medium-bodied frame of subtle tannin and oak. Dried cranberry comes in as a secondary detail, before the wine finishes in a blaze of leather and black tea.',\n",
       " \"Here's a rich Chardonnay with tropical fruit pastry flavors that have a dusty, dried herb edge, and lots of creamy oak. The wine is a bit soft. The fruit and spice flavors reprise on the long-lasting finish.\",\n",
       " \"Here's the latest entry into the red-hot unoaked Chardonnay category in America, and it's a solid hit. Dry and crisp, it's rich in apricots, pineapples, tangerines and spices.\",\n",
       " 'Ripe yellow apples and yellow pears meet with a tropical sense of guava and tuberose on this bottling from a vineyard near the intersection of Highways 101 and 154. The flavors are more tart, with green-apple flesh, light pear and a much more reserved touch of tropical fruit and flower.',\n",
       " \"Here's a rich, bone-dry Chardonnay that shows long hangtime flavors of peaches, apricots, tangerines, Meyer lemons, honeysuckle, custard and tangy minerals. It's brightened with crisp acidity. Super-drinkable.\",\n",
       " 'Ultrarich and oaky, with vanilla, buttered toast, caramel and smoky flavors accenting the underlying pineapple, guava, nectarine and pear fruits. This opulent wine will meld and become mellow in another 2–3 years.',\n",
       " \"A simple, likeable wine. It's nice for the upfront cherry jam, raspberry, cola and vanilla flavors and easy, silky texture, but there's not much depth. Drink now.\",\n",
       " 'A stylish Roussanne, built along the lines of a nice, rich Chardonnay. Feels full and creamy in the mouth, with interesting, complex flavors of peaches, apricots, sweet Meyer lemon, honeysuckle and oak. Crisp acidity is notable in the tart, clean finish.',\n",
       " 'Were this from a more prestigious winery it would command a considerably higher price, but evaluated on its own merits it is a stunning success. There is a vivid, broad middle palate of black cherry, cassis and plum; a fine acid structure, and hard, stiff tannins. But there is also an elegant complexity, highlighted with flavors of earth and iron, that comes from the soil. They speak to the extra care taken in the winemaking process so as not to obliterate the fragile taste of terroir with excess oak or overripe fruit.',\n",
       " 'Dry and earthy, with somewhat thin blackberry, currant, raisin, tobacco and black pepper flavors. A sound everyday Zin.',\n",
       " \"Biodynamic grapegrowing and stainless-steel fermentation have collaborated to produce this fresh, keen and brilliant young Sauvignon Blanc. It's so clean and zesty in acidity, you can't help but admire it, and the flavors only add to the attraction. Lemon, lime and grapefruit citrus have richer notes of figs, melons and vanilla. This is really a gorgeous, dry white wine.\",\n",
       " 'A blend of three quarters Chenin Blanc and one quarter Viognier, this fragrant and lively young white wine is loaded with pretty green and yellow fruits, nuances of citrus rind, and a textural freshness that keeps resonating through the finish.',\n",
       " 'A little soft and lacking in structure, but otherwise a beautiful Zinfandel, filled with alluring flavors, and entirely dry. Offers waves of ripe blackberry and cherry tart, licorice, cola, currant and Asian spices that finish long and fruity.',\n",
       " \"Steve Leveque, the winemaker at Chalk Hill, is doing everything right. Everything he touches is gold, including Cabernet. The '03 is extraordinarily balanced and beautiful, a dry, ripe wine of power and full-bodied substance, but enormous subtlety. The cassis fruit meshes seamlessly with toasty new oak to produce compellingly complex flavors. Drink now through 2010.\",\n",
       " 'A dry, hot, high-alcohol Zin with peppery flavors of cherry pie filling, red currants and licorice. Fine with barbecue.',\n",
       " 'An extravagantly perfumed Riesling billowing with white jasmine and elderflower notes. The floral tones are maintained on the palate as well, but interlaced with notes of stone and slate that add richness and complexity. The finish is dry and elegant, ending with a hint of bitter lime pith.',\n",
       " 'Smells very ripe, almost stewed, and it lives up to its name (The Monster) with big, rustic, extracted, alcoholic flavors. For those who like old-style Zin, with no-holds-barred power.',\n",
       " \"Bone dry and high in acidity, with lemon, lime and mineral flavors and hints of thyme and white pepper. Very nice and likeable, a sommelier's wine for pairing with a wide variety of food at an inexpensive price.\",\n",
       " 'The Fire Red is a four grape Bordeaux blend, with an interesting flavor mix that runs through red and black berries, cassis, cedar, smoke and dark chocolate. The 21 months in barrel (French and American) shows well, and the fruit and acids balance nicely against the roasty toasty espresso in the finish. Give it an hour or two to breathe and the midpalate fills in nicely.',\n",
       " \"Ripe with cherry-berry juiciness, this is a value-priced Zin that's straightforward all around, with a bitter taste to the finish.\",\n",
       " \"The vineyard is near the northwest edge of the Sonoma Coast, a wild, rugged mountainous region whose personality seems stamped on the wine. It's enormously rich in Dijonesque fruit, offering an array of red and black currants, cherries, pomegranates, anise, cinnamon and pepper. For all the opulence, the wine is dry and balanced. But it's just a baby. Hold until late 2010, if you can.\",\n",
       " \"Very tough and tannic now, and dry too, so that the ultimate impact is disagreeably harsh. That, despite a solid core of blackberries, black currants, violets, bacon and minerals. The question is one of ageability. The answer is that it's a gamble, as the wine, like the stock market, could go either way.\",\n",
       " 'Black and white pepper pop from the glass in this cool-climate, cool-vintage wine that retains just enough power around lacy acidity. A bouquet of violets rises on the nose before the palate offers spicy, lean bursts of meat, leather and black licorice. Made in small amounts, this wine is well worth seeking.',\n",
       " 'Grown in the Oakley area from (mostly) old vines, this Zin is dry, lush in texture and complex in flavors. It has lovely floral and mineral notes to the spicy raspberries, cherries, currants and cola. Great job at a good price.',\n",
       " 'A pretty good Cabernet, especially considering the price, which makes it ideal for everyday drinking. Dry and medium-bodied, it has pleasant blackberry, cherry, spice and oak flavors, with a long, clean finish.',\n",
       " \"Carignane and Petite Sirah join the party in this stewy, big and juicy wine, from head-trained vines averaging 45 years old. Briary blackberry mixes leather and fig compote with a strong seasoning of black pepper. There's no shortage of heat on the finish.\",\n",
       " 'This high-acid, intense wine is beautifully aromatic, with piercing and tart flavors of cranberry and raspberry, pure and laced with minerality. Terrific penetration, the persistence of wet stone, citrus, raspberry and cranberry flavors is impressive.',\n",
       " \"This vintage was a good one for Cameron Hughes' Bordeaux-style wines, and this Cabernet-based blend, which contains a splash of Carmenere, is as good as anything they've released. It's juicy-rich in blackberries, currants, carob and cedar, wrapped into firm, fine tannins.\",\n",
       " 'So delicious, so drinkably good, it defines the beauty of great coastal Syrah. A bit high in alcohol, but the heat fits in well beside the white and black pepper notes, and gives a lift to the vast blackberry, cassis, bacon and sandalwood flavors. Drink now through 2014.',\n",
       " 'An intense blue-purple wine, young, grapey and striking. The classic Klipsun core of iron/mineral is there, along with tight, spicy fruit, and plenty of acid for long-term aging. The complex layers of flavor are a good way from being fully integrated, but the track record of the winery and the vineyard suggest that they will come together beautifully over time.',\n",
       " 'Clean, zesty and flavorful Chardonnay, with complex notes of pineapples, oranges, Meyer lemon tart, buttered toast and spices. Earns extra points for fine acidity and a bracing minerality.',\n",
       " \"Warm summer weather ripened the grapes to black cherry and cocoa perfection, while cool nights preserved vital acidity. The oak tastes new and is in full balance with the wine's size. Despite a touch of raisins, this wine should hold and improve for five years before gradually losing fruit.\",\n",
       " 'A bit too strong in pyrazines, those notoriously green, feline aromas and tastes. Otherwise, the wine is crisp and pleasant in spearmint and citrus flavors.',\n",
       " \"Bigger, rounder, toastier yet stylistically of a piece with the winery's regular Chardonnay, this appealing bottling is extra soft and extra rich. The flavors are nicely balanced and creamy,  finishing with a sweet pBordeaux blend comes on with well-ripened fruit, pretty cherry flavors accented with barrel notes of kahlùa, espresso and smoke. Concentrated and smooth throughout, it is the star of this new winery's first lineup of wines.\",\n",
       " \"Disappointing, especially from this winery and vineyard, at this price. It's high in acidity and tough in tannins, and oak just adds a caramelized sweetness to the jammy raspberry and cherry flavors. This Syrah isn't going anywhere, so drink up.\",\n",
       " 'Pure Cabernet, a mix of Kiona and Conner Lee fruit. Chewy, tannic and grainy, it needs time, but it has great fruit that bursts into full blown flavor as soon as it hits the palate. What follows is an explosion of berries, stewed cherries, baking spice, coconut, cassis, cinnamon, sandalwood and more.',\n",
       " 'Too hot, with 15.6% alcohol, and it shows in the chile pepper heat. Also too soft, lacking structure. With the glycerine, it tastes like a sweet Starbucks drink with raspberry, mocha, vanilla and cinnamon flavors.',\n",
       " 'Pretty and pale, this wine is already showing some sunset shades around the rim, and drinking like a wine with more than just a couple of years under its belt. That works in its favor, as it offers cherry-pie fruit, cut tobacco, some minerality and a chocolate/coffee kiss in the finish.',\n",
       " 'Young, yeasty, almost to the point of being beery, this thin Sauvignon Blanc recalls a Vinho Verde. Cucumber and fennel flavors dominate, along with plenty of acidity.',\n",
       " \"At 2,523 cases, this is fabled grower Rochioli's largest-production Chardonnay. The bouquet sings with complex roasted nut, pineapple, citrus, toast and banana aromas. Tart apple and anise flavors play off the sweet caramel and vanillin oak to create an elegant balance on the palate. Persistent fruit and smoky accents on the finish—it's hard to resist. Top Value.\",\n",
       " 'This is not a successful Sleepy Hollow Vineyard bottling. The cold vintage took its toll, resulting in a wine whose cherry and tart cranberry flavors are cut through with a streak of green veggies. Drink up.',\n",
       " \"Potelle has quietly been crafting one of California's greatest Zins for many years now, from grapes on their mountain estate. There's always a claret-like balance, with beautifully pronounced fruit, near-perfect tannins and balancing acids without the high alcohol that plagues other Zins.\",\n",
       " \"An impressive Zinfandel, notable for its complexity and charm. Exudes quintessential Zin character, with a mouthburst of red currants, black raspberry pie filling, wild cherries, sweet charred oak and masses of freshly crushed black pepper. There's even a chocolaty richness in the finish. Production of 921 cases is decent in the old-vine Zin category.\",\n",
       " \"Syrah is winemaker Charles Smith's strongest suit, so it's not surprising that this is the best of The Orginals, his Magnificent Wine Company project. Fruit and spice are amped up equally, with whiffs of pepper and cut grass. It lingers in the throat with just a hint of alcohol.\",\n",
       " 'There is a grace and power to this wine that is quite fascinating and refreshing in a world of bruising, jammy fruit bombs. Fruit flavors of plum and blueberry and cassis segue smoothly into herbal and meat flavors, then nicely rounded tannins. There are no rough edges here, but a complex wine that glides through layers of spice, fruit, earth and barrel flavors with confidence and style.',\n",
       " \"A very nice Zinfandel for drinking steaks, chops and cheeses. It's dry and complex, offering earthy flavors of black and red currants, sage, tobacco and pepper. Lacks a bit of stuffing, but elegant and crisp.\",\n",
       " \"This 95% Cabernet Sauvignon perfectly captures the vineyard's strengths: lush, ripe, fleshy fruit that shows perfectly ripened flavors of cherry and cassis, bolstered by ripe, chewy tannins. It's substantial but not tiring; the balance of fruit, acid and tannins holds it together through a spicy, lingering finish. It's just a delicious wine, and one that should cellar well also.\",\n",
       " \"This is just a gorgeous wine, so easy to enjoy, juicy in watermelon, grapefruit and dark, baked strawberry tart, a taste of summer evoked from every sip. Textured and complex, it gives a squeeze of blood orange that lingers and remains fresh through the finish. It's from the owner's estate vineyard, sought after by many other producers and made by Siduri's Adam Lee.\",\n",
       " 'One of the more successful Bordeaux-style blends from the Happy Canyon section of the valley, this Cabernet Sauvignon-based wine is complex and layered. The blackberry, black currant and spice flavors have a nice coating of oak, and turn chocolaty-rich on the finish. A bit sharp in acidity, but a real step forward.',\n",
       " \"This may be a wrong estimate, but the wine tastes like it was made from younger vines in this large vineyard. It has that fresh, rude, jammy quality that trades complexity and ageworthiness for immediate appeal. Yet there's no denying the luxurious balance, and the deliciousness of the cherry, raspberry and cola flavors. Drink now.\",\n",
       " \"Stunning. Combines the fleshy opulence of a sweetly youthful Pinot with the balanced tightness and acidity of a young, cellar-worthy one. No small feat! From a cool vintage in a cool appellation that's increasingly known for Pinot Noir, the wine is pale in color and delicate in the mouth, yet powerful in cherry-cola and spice intensity. Gorgeous now, and should improve for six years before slowly bowing out.\",\n",
       " \"There's a beautiful wine in here, but it's buried under tannins. Also, the fruit is all primary blackberry, blueberry, raspberry and cherry jam, while the oak stands to the side, insistent in vanilla and toast. Nothing has merged, everything is separated. Yet this is a great wine, easily the greatest Cabernet to emerge from Livermore Valley in memory. Beautiful now, and should develop for a decade.\",\n",
       " \"Tough and chewy. Nonetheless there's a wealth of rich cherry pie, red currant and cedar flavor, and the mouthfeel is pure silk. A curiosity. May develop in the bottle, but probably best before 2013.\",\n",
       " 'Never effusively fruity, Hendry Chards are characterized by polished herb and mineral notes, although there are underlying peach flavors. This ultradry wine is crisp and earthy, with a complex balance that makes you like it more and more as you sip.',\n",

       " 'The blend is 88% Merlot and 12% Cabernet Sauvignon. From the first sniff to the last give-me-more swallow, this broadly delicious wine is going to win a lot of friends. The pretty strawberry and cherry fruit is generously endowed with mocha and chocolate, but the barrel flavors are not overbearing. Not one for the cellar; enjoy this wine in the fullness of its youth.',\n",
       " 'The alcohol comes in just under 14%, but the wine tastes a little harsh and the tannins hint at green tea flavors. The fruit is subdued, dark, a little smoky, peppery and very herbal. This definitely needs to be decanted.',\n",
       " \"It's 100% Cabernet, sappy, supple, silky and lush. It coats the palate and saturates the tongue with wild berries and black cherries. The oak is well-integrated and the extra time in bottle has melded it all together. Some lovely spice comes into the finish, along with coconut, vanilla cream and chocolate. Thoroughly delicious.\",\n",
       " 'A beautiful, rich, elegant, fancy sparkling wine. Feels so fine in the mouth, all silk and satin, with deep, dry raspberry, strawberry, vanilla, toast, yeasty lees, brioche and honey flavors. Superb, but young. Needs time. Give it until 2011, if you can keep your hands off, and should develop until 2015, if not longer.',\n",

       " \"This is the first Chardonnay release from Anam Cara, estate grown from young vines, and softened by secondary fermentation. The flavors suggest almond and butter, light citrus, a whiff of toast and a taste of cracker. It's smooth, with a lemony finish.\",\n",
       " \"Adelaida is assembling a good track record with this wine. It's from the cooler western portion of the appellation, so that crisp acidity provides a fine framework for the slightly sweet tropical fruit, wildflower and spice flavors.

       " 'The wine begins to change immediately; as soon as the cork is pulled the bouquet emerges and begins to evolve. Thin layers of scent and flavor are stacked, with rose petals on top, then supremely dense with darker layers of smoke, graphite, ash, mushroom, black fruits. The tannins never stick out and the flavors just keep on going, bringing in cured meats, mocha, and on and on.',\n",
       " \"Comes down on Petite Sirah's rustic, slightly sweet side. Even though the alcohol is pretty high, there's a sugary, porty finish to the blackberry and cherry jam flavors. The wine also has the bigtime tannins you expect from this variety, and should age for several years.\",\n",

       " \"I have not been impressed by this bottling in past vintages, but the '05 establishes a new benchmark. Just exactly why is hard to say.

       " 'Fans of oak and fruity tropical flavors will appreciate the price on this well-organized, everyday Chard. It shows pineapple custard, vanilla yogurt and cinnamon spice flavors wrapped into a dry, creamy texture set off by high acidity.',\n",

       " 'A single-vineyard wine from Oregon can be a component rather than a complete wine, but here it is an absolute joy. Fragrant and complex, this offers pleasures for both nose and palate, with scents of leaf and spice and herb, leading into a surprisingly dense and textural blend of wild berry, rhubarb, melon and mixed tropical fruits. Fascinating and long, this is a fine example of Oregon Pinot at its most elegant and fascinating.',\n",
       " \"Cooked or burnt black currants and caramelized oak are the flavors you'll find in this tannic wine. It feels heavy-handed, and is unlikely to develop with age.\",\n",

       " \"Tight, with a mix of berry, spice and a hint of Band-Aid. This needs decanting to show well; it's short and compact, concealing its flavors. Some cherry fruit and barrel flavors of chocolate and cinnamon, but this needs a lot more bottle age, or lengthy decanting.\",\n",
       " \"The second label for this new winery is made from grapes and barrels left out of the other blends. The result is a “mutt” wine that's red, ripe and slightly volatile. Though it lacks the focus and precision of the other blends, it's full of ripe, polished fruit flavors and makes a good barbecue or by-the-glass red wine. It's soft, smooth, with some citrus and tart berry flavors.\",\n",
       " 'Soft, smooth and elegant in texture, savory in flavor, this Central Coast Cab tastes of cherries, cassis, mocha and licorice. Smoky oak turns up on the finish. Forward enough to drink now, but it should hold for a couple of years.',\n",
       " \"Essentially the same blend as the outstanding 2006, the new vintage of DeLille's second red offers full, peppery flavors of currants and black cherries. You may wonder why fruit this good is declassified, until you taste the Chaleur Estate red. There's more than a touch of barrel here; and this young wine turns a bit liquorous.\",\n",
       " \"This is a huge Cabernet, very soft in the modern manner, and very ripe. It's a blast of cherry jam and milk chocolate, with plenty of toasty oak, and the tannins are firm and complex. Good now, it should hold well for the next ten years.\",\n",
       " \"Made from Cabernet Sauvignon and Syrah, this interesting blend seems ready to drink now. It's soft and smooth in the mouth, with opulently ripe flavors of blackberries, chocolate, bacon, sweet oak, pepper and a touch of funk.\",\n",
       " \"A disappointing vintage for the estate vineyard. It's earthy and bitter, showing far too much of the tomato-leaf herbaceousness that can plague Oregon Pinot. Leafy and chalky through the finish, it is a charmless, herbal wine.\",\n",
       " 'Sweet, soft and direct, like ripe blackberries, cocoa, anise, brown sugar, pepper and red wine mixed in a blender. Could develop bottle complexity down the road.',\n",
       " \"Raspberries, cherries, cola, exotic spices and sweet cedar mark the flavors of this Pinot Noir. It's elegant in the mouth, with brisk acidity, but also a distinct earthiness. The combination gives the wine a yin-yang of weight and weightlessness. It's too young to properly enjoy now, so drink from 2019 and beyond.\",\n",
       " \"Ripe, fleshy and opulent, this wine is also balanced and light on its feet, cohesive in oak and tannin. Dark cherry is the star, accented by anise, cola spice and a compelling hint of orange peel. Medium bodied, it'll pair well at the table, while also standing out on its own.\",\n",
       " \"From Klipsun and Hedges fruit, this muscular, aromatic Merlot begins with pretty berry scents, then develops flavors of currant and cherry. It's a wine with meat and muscle, still packed tight, but dense with potential. Give it plenty of decanting, or cellar it for five years.\",\n",
       " 'Very pretty nose, with plenty of raspberry-focused fruit, and a nice creamy mouthfeel. Delicious, mouth-filling, concentrated wine, with a lot of finesse and a wonderful ripeness. Smooth tannins, long finish, with a touch of toast.',\n",
       " 'Bright red-berry aromas, decent weight and slightly tough tanins in the finish all point to this as a good partner to grilled burgers this summer.  100% Merlot.',\n",
       " 'An array of damp, dank herbs shows on the nose of this bottling from the Fairbairn Vineyard, with aromas of oregano, thyme, chaparral and moist earth. The palate is relatively light in body, showing flavors of oregano-crusted pork roast and a woody character.',\n",
       " 'This bottling from esteemed producer Williams Selyem is a rich, concentrated wine, brimming with savory flavors of wild cherries and raspberries, red currants, milk chocolate, cloves and black pepper. The extraordinary tannins are smooth and as fine as velvet.',\n",
       " \"Heavy and soft, lacking the structure a red wine wants. But there's no problem with the flavors, which are fine. They're rich in black and red cherries, licorice, anise and black pepper, and the finish is thoroughly dry.\",\n",
       " 'This wine would compare favorably with the least expensive Sauv Blancs from New Zealand or Chile. It avoids the unripe pea vine or asparagus flavors that can afflict those wines, and brings light, fresh, sweetly grassy flavors to the palate. A little unfocused, but pleasurable and crisp, this is a good all-purpose seafood wine.',\n",
       " \"Intense and bright with a wonderfully complex nose of slate and stones, combined with elegantly subdued florals. It's dry, but there's a whisper of lemon drop sweetness throughout. Beautifully balanced with an intensely mineral, steely finish.\",\n",
       " 'A pure, lively scent of fresh apricots introduces this crisply defined Pinot Gris. The rich, full midpalate brings in further fruit notes of apple and pear, with a vivid and bracing acid foundation. Long and refreshing.',\n",
       " \"Handley's Anderson Valley bottling is always bright in acids, which are so nice and clean in a Chardonnay as fruity and rich as this. The flavors are a complex melange of pineapples, peaches and pears.\",\n",
       " 'A bit soft and melted, but offers exotically rich flavors of golden mango, pineapple and cinnamon spice, in a custardy texture.',\n",
       " \"Made in the drier, leaner, earthier and more Chablisian style that's increasingly popular, this Chardonnay is a natural for food pairings, such as shellfish. It's a minerally wine, with elegant citrus, kiwi and pear flavors and a streamlined complexity.\",\n",
       " \"Somewhat thin and acidic in cherry fruit, and also overoaked. It's as if they thought the aromas and flavors of smoky wood would compensate for a simple wine. Lacks richness.\",\n",
       " \"The '03 vintage is a particularly good year for D2. The warm, ripe vintage means that this second wine of DeLille  has unusual sweetness and richness across the palate. Toasty and laden with cherry/berry flavors, good weight and concentration, and enough stuffing to hang in there through a long, satisfying finish.\",\n",
       " 'A light mauve in color, this Pinot Noir-based wine shows boisterous plum fruit, macerated strawberries and a hint of clove on the ripe nose, making it more entrée-ready than apéritif-aimed. The palate offers strawberry and bubble-gum notes deftly hidden behind a veil of sour cherry and plum-skin tartness.',\n",
       " \"You'll find luscious flavors of sour red cherries, anise, pecan pie, cola and smoke in this dry wine. But it's a little too soft, structurally, which will limit development. Drink now.\",\n",
       " \"Soft, juicy and direct, this Cab offers lots of pleasure in its elegant balance of ripe cherry-berry fruit, rich tannins and fine acid-oak integration. It's the kind of Cab made for drinking with food, not worshipping. Should develop well over five years or so.\",\n",
       " \"When this hilly vineyard Cab first came out, it was very good, but quality has slipped over the years. The '04 is perfectly decent in oak-infused blackberry and currant flavors and rich tannins, and it may even improve for a few years.\",\n",
       " \"If you like 'em big and oaky, then this one's for you. Aromas and flavors of wood-grilled peaches, roasted red apples, buttery toast and rich nuttiness all generously abound. The mouth is full and slightly fat, with moderate acidity and a medium-length, smoky finish.\",\n",
       " 'Released at one year of age, this single-vineyard Zinfandel is too young for enjoyment. It shows hard tannins and tart, candied fruit flavors that have yet to emerge into bottle complexity. Give it until late 2010, and it should provide plenty of berry, cherry and spice enjoyment for a few more years.',\n",
       " 'Rustic and dry, this has flavors of berries, currants, licorice and spices. Made from Cabernet Franc and Cabernet Sauvignon.',\n",
       " \"Strong in every sense, with ripe pineapple, lemon and peach flavors and strong oak. Lacks subtlety, but it's crisp in acidity and shows a nice streak of minerals. Ready now.\",\n",
       " \"Clean and tart in lemon flavor, it has a bright streak of acidity throughout. Refreshing, it'll work well as an apéritif, a hint of pear lingering on the soft palate and finish.\",\n",
       " 'Smells distinctly Porty, with caramel and baked brown sugar, and turns meltingly soft and sweetish in blackberry pie filling and sweetened espresso flavors. Drink now.',\n",
       " 'Although the plush plum and coffee grind flavors combine seductively with hints of bramble and earth in this rustic, full-bodied wine, pervasive notes of char and a stalky, green character make this wine a bit clunky. Sturdy tannins, combined with black spice and tar drive a long finish.',\n",
       " 'Pours dramatically dark and brooding, with an enormous burst of white pepper, blackberry and coffee and an edge of smoked meat and leather. Huge in the mouth, with masses of blackberries, plums, espresso. Bone dry, thick in sweet tannins, and long on finish. Drink now— 2012.',\n",
       " \"Gainey's regular '05 was a beautiful wine. This is more full-bodied, richer and higher in alcohol, and merits its reserve status. It's a young wine, opulent in cherries and raspberries that have a baked pie-filling warmth, and complexed with cola, sweet leather, figs, pomegranates and dusty Asian spices. Very delicious now, it should develop additional complexities over the next six years.\",\n",
       " \"Ripe and powerful in blackberry, cherry, cassis and sweet oak flavors, with a spicy finish, this blend, which is mostly Cabernet Sauvignon, also is potent in tannins. It's a complex, nuanced wine, but is really too astringent for current consumption. Give it at least six years and try again.\",\n",
       " 'The nose is lively and jumpy with notes of tart gooseberry, Granny Smith apple, lemony citrus and a hint of fresh ginger. The mouth offers riper, more oaky flavors of toasted nuts and pear flesh that lead through to the finish. Well balanced and easy to drink; so approachable, an excellent choice for outdoor summer dining with company.',\n",
       " \"A blend of Syrah, Zin and several other Rhône varieties, this is a soft, lusty wine, likeable for its array of ripe, forward fruit flavors. Cherries, blackberries, raspberries and licorice flood the mouth, finishing with a peacock's tail of dusty Asian spices.\",\n",
       " \"This hasn't been my favorite Testarossa Pinot, although it's a very good one. It's a big, ripe wine, possibly ageworthy, with exuberant cherry, raspberry and new oak flavors. It has a gritty tannin structure that contributes to a slightly rustic mouthfeel.\",\n",
       " 'The Mark series from Anam Cara represents a sort of mini-reserve, all estate-grown, with a selection of what the winemaker considers to be the “boldest” clones. It has full-bodied flavors of cherry and sassafras, accented with cinnamon and cocoa. The barrel spices outlast the fruit—perhaps just an indication of youth. There is potential for considerable improvement with bottle age.',\n",
       " \"Raye's Hill has done a very nice job with this single-vineyard wine. It shows the coolness of the vintage and terroir in the crisp acidity and silky texture. The vintage's long hangtime also shows in the bright, pure fruit flavors. Cherries, raspberries, pomegranates, rhubarb and cola all come together in a long, spicy finish.\",\n",
       " 'Light, young vine fruit flavors mix strawberry and rhubarb, with a tangy, citrus component underscoring the midpalate. It gets a little more interesting in the finish, which brings in seed flavors and a lingering, orange juicy aftertaste.',\n",
       " 'Based on Cabernet Franc, with splashes of Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot and Petit Verdot, this complex wine is rich and softly tannic. It shows the fat, fleshy appeal of Cabernet Franc from the great 2007 vintage, and it has developed a mellowness from bottle age. It still offers oak-infused blackberry, cherry and dark chocolate flavors, plus emerging notes of herbs.',\n",
       " \"Another terrific wine from this vineyard, following the superb '07. May be a bit less flamboyant, but with better structure, and equally ageable. Dry and full bodied and fairly tannic, it shows powerful cherry and raspberry fruit, smoked meat, sautéed wild mushroom and sandalwood flavors, liberally spiced. Drinkable now, and should develop through 2014, at least.\",\n",
       " 'MCK stands for Motor City Kitty. The fruit has a sweet, plump character, ripe blackberries and black cherries, with soy and coffee streaks somewhat downplayed, though still evident. Tannins are firm and the wine is proportionate, though it hits 15.5% alcohol.',\n",
       " \"Made in a very ripe, extracted style, this eccentric wine has flavors of apricots, or more precisely, apricot marmalade on buttered toast, because it's also oaky. It's dry and crisp in acids. A bit unusual, but in its own way, a good wine.\",\n",
       " \"Green grass, cat pee, gooseberry and lemons and limes are the flavors that mark this crisp white wine. These strong flavors won't appeal to everyone. Nice with bruschetta with grilled veggies and chèvre.\",\n",
       " \"Named for Twisted Oak's infamous rubber chicken, Ruben, this Marsanne-Grenache Blanc-Roussanne blend is as fun as its namesake, with luscious lemon and a trace of tar in the background culminating in a dry freshness and just a tinge of almonds.\",\n",
       " \"New oak and ripe fruit combine to produce a user-friendly Chardonnay that's made in the popular style. It's enormous in pineapple, orange, mango and vanilla flavors that are brightened by crisp Carneros acidity.\",\n",
       " 'A soft, rather simple Pinot Noir, with cherry, cola and sweet oak flavors and a spicy finish. Good, but palls after a few sips. Drink now.',\n",
       " \"One of the sweetest California dessert wines out there, and all that honey goes a long way to make it likeable. The apricot, pear, pineapple and vanilla bean flavors taste like something from Starbucks, but could be a bit more concentrated. Still, it's certainly a decadent wine that will satisfy your sweet tooth.\",\n",
       " \"A dark, deep-colored Syrah that's dusty and austere but delicious, a good representation of the variety's ability to be both ripe and complex in California.\",\n",
       " \"Awkward. Despite some cherry jam and candied licorice flavors, accented by quite a bit of oak, there's a semi-sweet sharpness in the finish reminiscent of cough medicine, and a touch of sweaty funk.\",\n",
       " \"Here's a bright, exotically fruity Chard that satisfies all around for its lime, kiwi, butterscotch, fig, honey and toast flavors and brisk, cleansing acidity. Drink this yummy wine now.\",\n",
       " 'Beautifully feminine, with a delicate cherry-blossom perfume, this off-dry rosé sparkler blends juicy cherry and strawberry flavors, with a hint of earthy, mushroom goodness. Medium sized bubbles are brisk and tonic on the finish.',\n",
       " \"An easy, gentle Rhône blend that's ready to drink now. Shows polished flavors of cherries, raspberries and currants, with hints of anise, cocoa and pepper.\",\n",
       " \"If you're tired of sweet, soft, oaky whites, try this exciting blend of Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio and Viognier. It's the perfect recipe, combining crisp, tart citrus fruits with richer tropical fruits and honeysuckle. A beautiful wine that spans a huge spectrum of foods.\",\n",
       " \"The winery's Merlot has disappointed over the years, and the 2004 does little to change one's mind. It's overripe, with cooked or stewed raisin-currant flavors that make the tannins taste harsh and rasping. Okay, but not what this winery seems capable of.\",\n",
       " 'Softly lush, a nice, fruit-forward Cabernet to drink now. Shows well-ripened blackberry and black currant flavors, finished with a touch of smoky oak. Good price for a Stags Leap Cab.',\n",
       " 'Made with organically grown grapes, and harvested rather late (end of October) from vineyards in the Horse Heaven Hills, this is a surprisingly substantial, earthy offering. Raspberry and cherry fruit flavors are laced with graphite and iron ore, and some black olive herbal character adds interest to the finish.',\n",
       " 'This is a barrel-selection reserve, with unusual scents of pine needles and baking spices co-mingled. Deep cassis and dark chocolate flavors prevail, and the tannins have not yet softened and smoothed. Give this a few more years of bottle age.',\n",
       " \"Made largely of Cabernet Franc, this wine has all the elements of first-rate Meritage: ripe blackberry and blueberry fruit, accompanied by a blast of smoky oak. It tastes good, too, with pure, sweet, supple berry flavors; yet, it's very dry, with ample acidity. It lacks the focus of North Coast claret-style wines, but is certainly among the best of the genre from the South Coast.\",\n",
       " 'Hearty aromas of baking spices, roasted fennel, ginger and light licorice give nuance to dried cherry, cranberry, beef bourguignon and sweet onion scents on this wine from the eastside of the Salinas Valley. The palate is all about exotic spice, from sandalwood and myrrh to oregano, thyme, marjoram and black cardamom, all hanging on a lush, dark-fruit core.',\n",
       " 'Tannic and dusty, yet expressive with sassafras spice and hard cherry candy, this estate-grown Pinot Noir is finished at 13% alcohol, keeping it on the elegant side, with pleasingly soft tannins.',\n",
       " 'Very soft and powerful in cherry, raspberry, blackberry and chocolate flavors, with a honeyed, vanilla sweetness. Turns a little Porty on the finish.',\n",
       " \"Lava Cap Sauvignon Blanc is made from estate-grown grapes, then barrel ferments for a tropical, nutty, round version of the wine, with lots of creamy, tropical flavors. The finish shows off the wine's time in oak.\",\n",
       " 'Although the 2010 vintage was cooler than the previous two years, this Chardonnay still offers rich and luscious notes of crème caramel and baked pear. The intoxicating bouquet picks up layers of lemon zest and mineral.',\n",
       " 'Good everyday value in a Chardonnay. Shows a wealth of buttered toast, pineapple, lemondrop and cinnamon flavors, in a creamy texture.',\n",
       " 'Dry, silky and crisp in acidity, this Pinot offers easy flavors of red cherries, cola, licorice, orange zest and cedar, with a vast array of peppery spices. At its best now.',\n",
       " \"A racy, citric undertone and spicy toast beckon on this fun, fresh wine from New York. On the palate, there's an impressive roundness and a touch of butter on the tongue, but a very pretty wave of flowers, minerality and zip keep it light.\",\n",
       " 'Rich and dry, with a mélange of raspberry and cherry pie, cola, red licorice, bacon and sandalwood flavors, wrapped into firm but silky tannins. Acidity is quite nice, giving the richness a clean scour. Might develop subtleties over the years, but seems best now and through 2013.',\n",
       " 'Exciting, fresh and full of spicy, toasted undertones, this wine immediately calls for a food pairing of a richer seafood (think oysters, crab) or poultry. The flavors are balanced and buoyed by crispness, but the wine still offers complexity and a lingering finish.',\n",
       " \"A very fine Cab from the estate, which is in the north-central part of the Rutherford appellation. Judging from the tannins, it's too youthful to drink now, with a tight, astringent mouthfeel and fleshy, unintegrated oak. But the flavors are extraordinary. They flood the mouth with the essence of Cabernet, with ripe blackberries, black currants, raspberries and mocha, and the spicy finish lasts for a full minute. Give it until 2013, and it should provide great drinking through 2019, at least.\",\n",
       " \"Dry and fashionable, this has a dusty, minerally character and high acidity that's reminiscent of a good Chablis. The cool, long vintage resulted in subtle peach, pear, pineapple and spice flavors.\",\n",
       " 'Cherries are the name of the game here, from beginning to end. Red cherries, black cherries, cherry jam, cherry pie, cherry liqueur. The texture is smooth, and the finish is dry. This is a nice, fairly complex wine that will elevate a great cheeseburger.',\n",
       " \"Sometimes it seems that our white wine industry could become a Chardonnay monoculture. It's good to see that Fetzer isn't abandoning their efforts with other varietals. Sweet peach, mild lychee and spice aromas open this unabashedly sweet and easy wine, with its tangerine flavors and slight spritz on the round palate. Not very complex or sophisticated, but broadly appealing\",\n",
       " \"A nice, full-bodied Cabernet with some fancy features. It's a bit tight and tannic now, with the ripe blackberry fruit unintegrated with the 40% new oak, but a few hours of decanting should help. Contains all five Bordeaux varieties, which adds complexity.\",\n",
       " \"Peppery and stemmy, with a wintergreen tartness that suggests unevenly ripened grapes. The berry-cherry flavors are diluted. Still, it's a clean, dry wine at a decent price.\",\n",
       " \"The winery was one of the first to specialize in Cab Franc, and Premier Etage is their reserve-style bottling. The '03 is a very good wine, but misses the richness of the '01 and '02. With its soft, silky, almost Pinot-esque mouthfeel and flavors of cherries and cassis, it possesses great elegance and sophistication. Drink now.\",\n",
       " \"Polished and balanced, this masterpiece shows restraint and it's already drinkable. With its great acidity and its fine intermingling of spice and red fruit flavors, this wine will appeal to lovers of Gamay and Pinot Noir.\",\n",
       " \"In a stunning lineup of Cayuse Syrahs, the En Chamberlin wins by a nose. It's smooth and silky, with a tongue-bending blend of flavors that include blood and iron, umami and salt, at first overtaking the pure fruit, but adding tremendous depth and power. The endless finish unfolds into a wine with exotic spices and complex layering.\",\n",
       " 'Some green tannins and stemmy scents can be found in the nose and tasted in the finish, but this has good concentration and stiff black fruits as well. Licorice and vanilla are woven into a wine that is still pulling itself together.',\n",
       " 'One of the few dessert wines in California made from Chardonnay in California, this is very sweet, with a ton of residual sugar and a dominating apricot-honey note.',\n",
       " \"Heat marks this wine. It smells and tastes peppery, along with deeply extracted flavors of currants, licorice, violets and cedar. Bone dry and pretty hard in tannins, with the oak showing, it's a bit austere and clumsy now. Needs time, and could be quite good after 2011.\",\n",
       " 'This vineyard-designated Sauvignon Blanc is full and round, with lots of oak over the mild grapefruit flavors, and very creamy texture. It tastes like a California version of a white Bordeaux, and finishes with spicy oak notes',\n",
       " 'A good 100% Cabernet, with complex, pleasant cherry, blackberry and oak flavors. Quite tannic now, with a sandpapery mouthfeel, and very full-bodied. Feels a little ponderous, but could be going through an awkward phase. Try again after 2013.',\n",
       " \"Dry, crisp and elegantly structured, which are the best features of Lake County Sauvignon Blanc. But there's just too much feline essence and asparagus, and it's pretty aggressive.\",\n",
       " \"What a beautiful Pinot Noir for drinking now with lamb chops or maybe a rich, exotic Ahi tuna tartare. Brilliantly crisp in acidity, with a clean, bracing mouthfeel, it offers dazzlingly rich flavors of raspberries, cherries, orange zest, Dr. Pepper cola and Asian spices, with smoky oak adding elaborate tiers of vanilla char. For the price, it's a very great buy.\",\n",
       " 'Lush and fragrant, and happily and distinctively not tasting like a Washington Cabernet or Merlot, this is a bowl of rose petals and ripe cherries. Strong acids, earthy tannins, slivers of chocolate and a finish of espresso all combine into a lovely and lasting set of flavors. 100% varietal, aged in neutral barrels.',\n",
       " \"A rough, common Pinot Noir. It's all right for drinking now, with pleasant cherry, berry, cola and cedar flavors that have an edge of overripe raisins.\",\n",
       " 'Strong and flashy, not particularly subtle, but impressive in sheer volume, which is a mark of many Santa Lucia Highlands wines. In this case, the wine shows brisk acidity that lends clean balance to the huge orange, mango, apricot, vanilla and buttered toast flavors.',\n",
       " 'Spicy, toasty and dense, this 47% Merlot, 30% Cabernet Sauvignon, 13% Cab Franc and 10% Malbec blend is packed with berry and cassis fruits. Young and persistent, it runs through the bright luscious raspberries into a deeper layer of stone and licorice. Beautifully defined, with a panorama of red and black fruits and excellent persistence.',\n",
       " 'Fat and delicious. Marked by huge, explosive blackberry, cassis, beef jerky and pepper flavors, housed in a fine structure. Wonderful tannins, rich and firm, with enough acidity for balance. Drink this full-bodied red wine over the next five years.',\n",
       " \"Spiced up with tobacco, mint and a bit of pepper, this light, herbal Syrah shows that you don't need 15% alcohol levels of ripeness to make a flavorful, complex wine.

       " \"Fruit and oak combine in this young, sensuous wine to make for immediate drinkability, but it's ageable. Floods the mouth with ripe, forward flavors of blackberry pie with the smoky-sweet crust, and there are notes of cola, black currant liqueur and Indian spices. This is a very fine, elegant Cabernet, with superfine tannins. It should age well throughout the decade.\",\n",
       " \"A terrific Chardonnay. You won't miss the oak at all. Offers a wealth of pineapple pie, Meyer lemon sorbet, green apple jam and vanilla flavors, brightened by clean, crisp coastal acidity. Sommeliers, buy this one in quantity. Easy to find, with 45,000 cases produced.\",\n",
       " 'From the smoky, spicy nose through the spicy apple notes in the mouth, this bottling has an intriguing earth and mineral streak from start to finish. Medium-bodied, the wine offers some lemon and mineral tang and a lot of smoky oak on the finish.',\n",
       " \"Only 1000 cases of this wine were made, from some of the oldest Syrah vines in the Sierra Foothills. Sharp herbal aromas with a hint of green ride over bacony, meaty notes accented by smoky oak. The texture is velvety smooth, and fruity flavors fan out over the palate. It's dry, balanced and complex.\",\n",
       " 'This Merlot-Cabernet Blend is quite tannic, chewy and tight. It certainly does not lack flavor, however, the notes of cassis and peppery herbs are set in a rough-and-tumble frame of massive tannins. This one needs to be paired with a thick, greasy steak.',\n",
       " \"This barrel-fermented Chardonnay shows smoky new oak and telltale matchstick leesy aromas. Real spiciness comes through on the palate.

Give this one four to six months to knit itself together.\",\n",
       " 'Strikingly original, with subtle flavors of citrus, juniper, pine needle, dried herbs and mint. Harvested at less than one ton an acre, this distinctive, compelling wine is built around tart cranberry fruit. Long, penetrating and persistent.',\n",

Will gradually lose fruit over the next 10 years, becoming nuttier and drier.',\n",
       " \"This is an excellent Syrah, and it's right up there with the winery's Clone 877 bottling. It's nearly identical, with rich, sweet tannins, crisp acids and complex, intricate flavors of blackberries, plums, coffee, white pepper, sweet leather and smoky oak. The finish is dry and satisfying.\",\n",
       " \"From a new appellation in Lake County comes this very interesting single-vineyard Syrah. At first it seems like a jammy flatterer, but then more complex layers kick in. It's a big, soft wine with intense blackberry and cassis fruit that turns chocolaty on the finish.\",\n",
       " 'Powerful and intense in flavors of pineapples, mangoes, sweet cream and buttered popcorn, with good acidity. Flamboyant, but it feels over-worked and too sweet.',\n",
       " 'Fruity and oaky, with firm, dry tannins housing flavors of cherry pie filling, Dr. Pepper cola, sandalwood, mocha, anise and pepper. Tasty and rewarding, a good companion for sandwiches, smoked meats and burgers. Cabernet Sauvignon and Syrah.',\n",
       " 'Root beer, cola nut, black cherry, black raspberry and anise seed combine for an exciting nose on this bottling from a winery near Morgan Hill. The mouthfeel is full, with graphite and lively fennel-bulb spice mixing with blackberry fruit and an earthy elegance on the pleasing palate.',\n",
       " \"“Nu” seems to be Kunde's way of letting us know that this is an unoaked Chardonnay. It shows pure, untrammelled Chard flavors of green apples, peaches, pears, kiwis and limes. It's also a very crisp wine, as it did not undergo the malolactic fermentation.\",\n",
       " 'Smells and tastes like caramel and stewed cherry and blackberry flavors that taste overtly sweet. However, this rustic blend of Syrah and Sangiovese may have its fans.',\n",
       " 'This creamy Chard has good varietal character, with pleasant peach, green apple and cinnamon spice flavors.',\n",
       " \"The Cabernet Sauvignon is from vines planted in 1972—fruit that once went into Leonetti Cab. The other half is evenly split between Merlot and Cab Franc, crafting a flavor mix of herb and earth, with moderate density. It's nicely spiced, with brambly red fruits, and some butterscotch coming into the finish.\",\n",
       " \"Maryhill's Proprietor's Reserve bottling features heavy barrel toast and more extraction than the regular Sangiovese. It is very soft, very approachable, smooth and sweet, with a finish that tastes of strawberries and cream. Definitely a consumer-pleasing style.\",\n",
       " 'This is a softly appealing single-vineyard wine to drink now. It shows fine Napa Valley structure, with gentle tannins and cleansing acidity framing cherry, sandalwood and sweet tobacco flavors. With such elegance, it will be a fine partner to steak.',\n",
       " 'Dark, dry and rich, this Syrah is tough and astringent now, but it may develop in time. The thick tannins, supporting acidity, and heart of cherry liqueur, blackberry jam, chocolate and sweetly smoked leather strongly suggests aging. Hold until 2008.',\n",
       " \"With rich, decadently delicious raspberry and cherry pie filling flavors, this is an impressive young Pinot. It's so sweet in fruit and oak, yet entirely dry in the finish, and the silky texture and elaborate oak overlay are just perfect. Hard to predict its longterm future, but it will make for elaborate drinking over the next four years.\",\n",
       " \"Once upon a time, this valley, south of San Francisco, was wine country. Today, it's Silicon Valley, but scattered vineyards still prove its worth. This is a lovely, food-friendly Pinot Noir, rich in fruit and acids, and elegantly balanced.\",\n",
       " \"A blend of four Bordeaux varieties with 25% Zinfandel, this wine shows its origin in the soft texture and raisiny midpalate. It's a plushly pleasant, full-bodied, tannic wine with Cabernet-esque qualities, while that Zin adds a wild, brambly, spicy note.\",\n",
       " \"Lots of rich, ripe varietal flavor in this dry, tannic young Cabernet. It's strong in blackberries and cassis, with a cedary edge that has the scent of a cigar box. Firm enough to develop some bottle complexity over the next 6 years or so.\",\n",
       " \"Herbal and tannic, this won't be mistaken for a cult Cab, but in its price range it offers authentic Cabernet flavors. The fruit is lean and the tannins slightly green, and the herbal side of the grape is much in evidence. But everything is in balance, and it avoids the watery soda pop flavors of most cheap Cabs.\",\n",
       " \"Dry and zesty in mouthwatering acidity, this clean wine features upfront flavors of lemons, limes, grapefruits and oranges. It's a nice cocktail sipper at a good price.\",\n",
       " \"There's a Floodgate Vineyard in Anderson Valley that produces very nice Pinot Noirs, but this one says it's from Russian River Valley. This wine is average in quality. It has a fine, silky mouthfeel, with some good cherry flavors, but also a sharp, green touch of mint that's unlikely to age out.\",\n",
       " \"Mainly Syrah, with some Pinot Noir, this is a dry, tannic wine. It's not likely to age, but is pleasant for the clean, brisk, silky mouthfeel and flavors of black cherries, currants, bacon, violets, sandalwood and pepperspice. Argues for more bottlings of this unique blend.\",\n",
       " \"Here's a nice, easy Rhône blend based on Grenache. Ready to drink now, it's dry and rich in red and black cherries, Dr. Pepper cola, bacon and sandalwood flavors, with smooth tannins.\",\n",
       " 'Barrel fermented and aged on the lees for almost a year, this is a nutty, slightly oily wine that shows the influence of the barrel, but lacks the fruit density to match it. The 14% alcohol hits the palate with some heat. High-toned and a bit harsh.',\n",
       " 'This blend of Cabernet, Syrah and Zinfandel is simple, soft and overtly sweet. It has berry, cherry, currant and chocolate flavors that taste sugary, like pie filling.',\n",
       " 'Affordable and friendly, this refreshing wine offers strawberry jam and orange marmalade on the nose and a mineral-driven flavor profile. The fruit is overtaken by the acidity to some extent, but the wine still makes for a tasty warm weather sip.',\n",
       " 'Impressively dry, medium bodied, very firmly tannic and showing complex fruit flavors, this Zinfandel-based wine needs time to mellow. It smells like fresh raspberries and blackberries, and tastes concentrated and mouthcoating, while the astringent tannins hold everything back just a bit. It contains 34% Syrah and 21% Petite Sirah, and will be best after 2018.',\n",
       " 'An everyday sort of Pinot Noir, soft and juicy in raspberries and cherries, with a kiss of oak. It has a nice, silky mouthfeel.',\n",
       " \"Scented with green gooseberry aromas, this 100% Sauvignon Blanc isn't for everyone. It's enriched by citrus and peach fruit, and by creamy lees and a touch of oak.\",\n",
       " \"A Syrah that puts many more famous bottlings to shame. It's a little soft, but wonderfully rich and complex in berry, cherry, prosciutto, anise, white pepper and sandalwood flavors that go on and on, and finish is long and spicy. Not an ager, but a beautiful wine to drink now.\",\n",
       " \"Not surprisingly, this is similar to the Chards from this vineyard from Rob Talbott, which develop for a long time in the bottle. The wine is bone dry and very high in acidity, with a stony minerality to the peach and pineapple flavors. It's really too young now, but should begin to be ready by 2007.\",\n",
       " \"This is a sleek Malbec, adorned with generous baking spices around a firm core of wild blueberry fruit. It's brambly and attention-grabbing, with good length and a bit of dark chocolate in the finish.\",\n",
       " \"Plenty of zesty Central Coast acidity on this Pinot, and it's nicely dry. But it's thin and unrewarding in richness.\",\n",
       " 'Subtle aromas of freshly cut grass and crisp Asian pears make this clean, dry Riesling a refreshing sipping wine. A tingly acidity and citrus pith notes linger playfully on the palate.',\n",
       " \"More tannicly dense than Failla's estate Sonoma Coast bottling, this Pinot wants a few years in the cellar. You can drink it now because it's so delicious in cherry and raspberry fruit, but there's a tightness, an astringency that suggests 3-4 years to come around. If you pop the cork now, give it a few hours of decanting.\",\n",
       " 'Harsh in acids, simple and fruity sweet in jammy raspberries. A blend of Grenache, Syrah and Mourvèdre.',\n",
       " \"Super-rich, a fat, opulent Chard that tastes almost as sweet as a dessert, except it's dry. Shows massive flavors of Meyer lemon custard, minerals, pear tart, buttered toast, butterscotch, smoky pie crust and honey, with a sprinkle of cinnamon and nutmeg. Lush and gorgeous.\",\n",
       " 'A blend from two well-regarded vineyards, this Chardonnay is ultrarich in pineapple, mango, pear and green apple fruit flavors that are liberally accented with sweet, caramelized oak. Crisp acidity and a steely minerality fortunately provide balance. Drink now.',\n",
       " \"This is a floral blend of 48% Roussanne, 35% Marsanne and 17% Viognier. The Roussanne speaks loudest, while the whole offers a mix of dried and fresh apricot and creamy vanilla wafer that's light bodied and fresh with acidity.\",\n",
       " \"Much like Apolloni's Olivia Vineyard Pinot Noir, this acidic, astringent wine seems severely constrained. The winemaking is solid, the fruit leans hard on tart red berries, but the wine has a hard shell around it. More bottle age might open it up.\",\n",
       " 'Lean and austere in style, this dry Riesling offers steely notes, savory herbs and crisp pears combined with a shot of intense, lemon-lime acidity.',\n",
       " \"Pinot Noir just doesn't get richer than this. It floods the mouth with ripe flavors of raspberries and cherries, with fascinatingly earthy things, like truffles and pine cones. Vibrant acidity and a hint of furry tannins give it a fine structure. This upscale Pinot Noir is drinkable now and should evolve over the next six years.\",\n",
       " \"The blend of this wine is Viognier, Marsanne, Chardonnay and Roussanne. It's honeyed on the palate with tropical fruits, but marred by a vegetal streak of boiled asparagus that's hard to get over.\",\n",
       " \"Texture is the name of the game here. We're talking pure velvet, the way the wine glides over the palate with hardly a wrinkle. Beyond the mouthfeel are flavors so complex, they're hard to describe. The blend consists of Cabernet Sauvignon, with contributions from Cab Franc, Malbec and Petit Verdot, and each grape brings its own distinction, as does 100% new oak. It's approachable now for the softness, and should glide through the next 6–8 years with ease. Expensive, yes, and only 344 cases were produced, but it's worth the search.\",\n",
       " \"This baby Cabernet plays tricks on the palate, showing appealing soft, delicious complexity, then retreating into a cloak of tannins, and then emerging again with sweet fruit and spice. It's bone dry, although the cherries and blackberries show a baked-into-the-pie caramelized sweetness. Give this bottle a good six years in the cellar, and it should continue to evolve for far longer.\",\n",
       " \"Believe me, you won't miss the oak barrel influence on this wine. It's so good all by itself. Brightened with crisp Monterey acidity and totally dry, it's rich in pineapple, tangerine, Meyer lemon, lime, mineral and vanilla flavors that will satisfy your Chardonnay tooth.\",\n",
       " \"Tastes more like a Zinfandel than a Cabernet, with a briary mouthfeel and flavors of black pepper and weedy green nettles. But there's lots of blackberry and black currant richness, and the wine is totally dry, with full-bodied, thick tannins. Unusual for a Cabernet, but a nice, complicated red wine for drinking with grilled meats.\",\n",
       " \"A sweet but spicy nose of honeysuckle and pear, and a flavor profile of tropical fruit and honey, make this Riesling an attractive wine to pair with food or enjoy on it own. There's sweetness but it's well-balanced with a minerality and acid that gives it lift. Good weight but a pretty touch.\",\n",
       " \"Superrich in tangerine, peach, lime, mango and honey flavors, this Rhône-style white blend is balanced with crisp acidity and a nice touch of minerality. It's a wine to drink now.\",\n",
       " 'Full-bodied, soft and approachable, with rich aromas of vanilla, graham cracker and chocolate overlaid on flavors of cassis and cherry. Clove notes accent fine tannins on the finish.',\n",
       " 'Firm and compact, it mixes wild berry, plum and cassis fruits, giving this Cab-dominated blend the sleek appeal of a good St. Emilion, but without the aggressive herbaceousness. There is no obvious new oak here, but lovely suggestions of barrel that never override the superb fruit.',\n",
       " \"This is a Zin for the cellar. It's fine now in rich fruit, but fairly tannic, and there's some tension of parts that 3–4 years should resolve. Shows very pure, focused black currant and cedar flavors, liberally dusted with peppery spices. The challenge with these big Zins is balance, which Sanctuary's '06 achieves.\",\n",
       " 'Sharp and jammy, like Lifesaver cherry and blackberry sour candy. Finishes sweet in fruity extract.',\n",
       " 'This blend of 39% Cabernet Sauvignon, 52% Merlot and 9% Cabernet Franc is a jewel; sappy and seductive, loaded with cassis and boysenberry, tart and racy, and defined with sharp tannins. A strong and well-ripened herbal character infuses the red-fruit core, giving the wine length and style; it is just at the edge of showing some heat on the finish. Cellar for 8 to 10 years.',\n",
       " \"Blow your Freaking Mind is what BFM stands for. It's a Bordeaux blend, mostly Merlot, with sharply-defined berry-flavored fruit, bright acidity and a fine focus. The mix of Wisconsin and French oak (60% new) gives it a pleasing, chocolaty finish.\",\n",
       " 'This blend of Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot and Cabernet Franc exemplifies the Terlato style, which is classic, complex and drinkable early. It has rich, thick tannins and flavors of blackberries, mocha and cedar. The finish is long and spicy.',\n",
       " \"A rich effort, this offers ripe pear, citrus and tropical fruit flavors. Interesting notes of mushrooms and dried fruits are beginning to emerge, although that might indicate the wine's limited ageability. Drink over the next 1–2 years.\",\n",
       " \"A very good wine from one of the newer entries to the Farrell pantheon of vineyard-designated Chardonnays. It's brisk in acidity, with voluptuous tropical fruit and green apple flavors. New oak brings the usual complexities of buttered toast and vanilla. The texture is just a little scoury. Drink now.\",\n",
       " 'Very sweet and honeyed, which makes it easy to drink despite a certain lack of body. Shows rich, exotic flavors of orange tart, tropical fruits, honey, vanilla, crème brûlée and candied ginger. A blend of Muscat and Verdelho.',\n",
       " \"Shows that typical enormous Santa Lucia fruit that's so massive that it just stuns. Offers gobs of cherry marmalade, blueberry pie filling, pomegranate and cola-root beer flavors, yet the wine somehow stays silky-elegant. Who knows where it's going, but it's delicious now.\",\n",
       " \"This softly delicious, complex wine is one of the reasons why Pinot Noir has soared in popularity lately. Made from the Dijon clones that give such fruity wines in California, it's filled with raspberry, cherry and smoky cedar flavors, with the silky elegance you want from this variety. Drink this flashy wine soon, to fully appreciate the youthful fruit.\",\n",
       " 'A blend of Syrah, Mourvèdre and Grenache, this has a chocolate mint edge to the sugary sweet LifeSaver candy blackberries and cherries. The tannins and acids are good, though, and the wine would score higher if it were drier.',\n",
       " \"Despite the high rent district of Mount Veeder, this isn't a very interesting wine. It's very dry and pretty tannic and not particularly delicious, with modest cherry, grilled meat and sweaty leather flavors.\",\n",
       " 'Muted on the nose, this offers shy notes of anise and fennel that arises out of the glass over time, buoyed by a generous proportion of golden apple and honey. It veers briny around the full-bodied finish.',\n",
       " 'This wine shows the richness of the vineyard, offering flashy flavors of raspberry and cherry jam, licorice, brown sugar and  smoky oak. Balanced with bright acidity, this is meant to be consumed now and over the next few years.',\n",
       " 'Open tonight and enjoy for its immediate pleasures. Soft and expressive, it shows a wealth of cherry, blackberry, raspberry, cola, licorice, cedar and vanilla-spice flavors that are wrapped into rich, finely ground tannins. Nice with a grilled steak.',\n",
       " \"Much improved over the unripe 2005, Fritz's 2006 is quite a delicious and sophisticated Sauvignon Blanc. Partially barrel fermented and with some Musque clone for complexity, it's richly textured and creamy, with a mélange of pineapple, Meyer lemon, Asian pear, lychee, fig and dusty spice flavors.\",\n",
       " \"Here's a vintage-driven wine that needs the right conditions to succeed, which 2006 provided with its long, cool hangtime. The fruit has ripened to perfection, offering deep flavor notes of blackberries and raspberries. But there are also exotic and delicious notes of bacon, mocha and cola with a blast of black pepper throughout. The wine is full-bodied and dense in tannins, impressive from start to finish. Great now, and should age for 4–6 years.\",\n",
       " 'The BSH blend is 70% Cab, 13% Cab Franc and 17% Merlot. Cherry fruit holds down the core here, with good concentration that is highlighted with one-third new French oak. High-toned notes in the nose, and a bit of wet dog in the finish.',\n",
       " 'Concentrated and stylish, this is a potent Merlot with sharp, ripe, tight fruit flavors. Compact plum, black cherry and cassis fruit is wrapped in juicy acids and plenty of coffee-flavored barrel toast. Still young and a bit hot, this wine needs several hours of breathing time to really open up.',\n",
       " 'A delicious and refreshing white made with 70% Muscat Ottonel, 15% Chardonnay and 15% Viognier. Very aromatic on the nose with notes of sweet pea florals, lilac, lychee, ripe pear and fresh orange slices. The palate is medium weight but vibrant, with more ripe tropical fruit unfolding in the mouth and on the finish. A different but excellent option as an apéritif to pair with spicy appetizers.',\n",
       " 'A little bitter and raw, with irregular tannins and a green edge of mint to the cherries and blackberries. Drink this country-style wine with simple fare.',\n",
       " \"This is the driest, most concentrated and sophisticated of Kenwood's current trio of Merlots, and also the only one that will benefit from cellaring. It's compact in blackberry, currant, tea, leather and spice flavors that finish with a scour of tannins. Best 2008–2011.\",\n",
       " \"Here's a soft, simple Pinot, with one-dimensional raspberry, cherry and oak flavors. It has a jammy, syrupy finish.\",\n",
       " \"You'll want to cellar this young Cab because presently it's too tannic and closed in for pleasure. Yet it has the stuffing to age. There's a big core of black currant fruit, and the wine's balance should allow it to effortlessly come together by 2010.\",\n",
       " \"Grown at a high altitude above Alexander Valley, this Merlot shows dense, hard mountain tannins that lock it down in astringency. The question with such wines always is, will it age? In this case, despite a rich core of cherries and blackberries, it's doubtful. The wine is so unusually tough that the tannins seem likely to outlive the fruit.\",\n",
       " 'A very nice white wine to drink as a versatile apéritif. Dry and crisp, it shows vibrant flavors of Mandarin oranges, Meyer lemons, honeysuckle flowers and vanilla, finished with peppery spices. Try it as an interesting and exotic alternative to Sauvignon Blanc.',\n",
       " 'Mainly Roussanne, with a dollop of Viognier, this brilliant white wine is largely from the Santa Valley, which accounts for its brilliant ripeness. Just massive in white flowers, fresh white peaches, yellow apricots, pears, sautéed bananas, toasted coconut, vanilla and firm minerals. Lots of new oak, but the underlying wine easily supports it. A tremendous, impressive wine.',\n",
       " \"Opens with aromas of wild berries, white pepper, earth and a trace of leather. Tough and unyielding tannins coat the palate, and you'll need some meat to break through this gridlock, but underneath it all is a core of ripe dark-berry fruit. This could use 3–6 years of aging.\",\n",
       " \"Give this Pinot Noir a few hours in the decanter before drinking it. Right out of the bottle, it's tight and brittle, but air brings out the core notes of cherry, vanilla, red currant and cedar, and makes it develop a drink-me-now appeal.\",\n",
       " \"Powerful aromatics lead to powerful fruity flavors in this Rhône-style wine. A blend of Viognier, Marsanne and Roussanne, it explodes in apricot and peach juice, vanilla bean and honeysuckle flavors that finish dry and spicy. The high alcohol isn't a problem.\",\n",
       " \"A very finely crafted Pinot Noir, although it's also very young and wants some time in the cellar. Combines great Highlands fruit power and tannic structure with a silky, delicate mouthfeel. Beautiful now for the elaborate raspberry and cherry flavors, elaborated with beautiful oak, but better after 2013.\",\n",
       " \"The cherry and smoke aromas wear an attractive olive-herb note, but the fruit could use more weight and definition. Feels like many Merlots, with its very soft, plummy mouthfeel, although the flavor range is darker, showing more blackberry and cassis. Feels a little slick or sappy, but the cassis and licorice flavors on the back end pull this beginner's Cab through.\",\n",
       " 'This is pleasant and light, with just 12% alcohol and enough acid to keep the sweetness at some distance. Simple, slightly sweet and citrusy, it is a well-made, widely available, representative bottle of budget Riesling in the Washington style.',\n",

Harvester is a blend of 38% Pinot Gris, 34% Riesling and 28% Chardonnay that's austere aromatically and deep golden in color, woody and tasting of tart green apple, unearthed mushrooms with a lemony finish.\",\n",
       " \"Baked bread and brown sugar make this a comforting wine in some sense. Similarly, the fruit follows a baked quality that makes it taste bigger than it is. Meanwhile, herbal leanings betray the wine's low level of alcohol.\",\n",

The palate rides the line expertly between ripeness and tartness, with fresh boysenberry flavors and dried oregano, altogether excellently spiced.\",\n",
       " \"It's amazing how rich this is, given the pale, translucent ruby color. Waves of cherries, raspberries, roasted hazelnuts, cola, pomegranates, herb tea, dusty Asian spices and smoky oak change constantly in the glass, as the wine breathes and endlessly fascinates. Bone-dry and tartly crisp, the wine will develop bottle complexities over the next eight years.\",\n",
       " \"A bit over the top in fruity extraction, a bomb blast of sweet raspberry, cherry and blackberry jam. It's almost like a dessert wine.

       " \"Heavy and densely tannic now, and not showing its best. It's an embryonic Cabernet that's all about potential. Analysis reveals deep, buried flavors of blackberries, black currants and cedar that are impressively potent. Needs a bit of time to come around. Try in 2013.\",\n",
       " 'Tough, with sweet and sour flavors of cherries and currants. Fruit forwardness characterizes this rustic young wine.',\n",

       " 'Pure Cabernet Sauvignon, this brings full-on dark fruits, smoke, licorice and black-tea flavors into the core palate. Despite its power, the wine has a sculpted quality, a nice sense of depth, yet with immediate appeal. The tannins are polished and fine, the acids just right to give the wine crisp edges and focus.',\n",
       " \"A bit overripe, with some pruney, raisiny aromas and flavors. If you can get past that, you'll find a dry, tannic wine with essential blackberries and currants. A Bordeaux blend based on Merlot.\",\n",

       " \"La Fenetre scores with this lush, forward Pinot Noir that offers enough flavor to please almost anybody. It's enormously rich in raspberry and cherry pie filling, roasted almond granola, vanilla cream, buttered cinnamon toast and sandalwood flavors that are so delicious, they're sweet, except that the wine finishes dry. Great with lamb. Drink now.\",\n",

       " \"A limited (350 case) selection of Bel'Villa and Hedges vineyard fruit, this 80-20 Cab-Syrah blend is focused, young, tight and full of promise. Cranberry, cherry and currant fruits are married to light chocolate, black tea and that gravelly Red Mountain minerality.\",\n",
       " \"This is a big, ripe, full-bodied and oaky Pinot Noir. It's too powerful to drink now, unless you don't mind immaturity. The raspberry, cherry and blood orange flavors are of the pie-filling type, and the oak sticks out in smoky, vanilla sweetness. Give it 4–5 years in the cellar to come around.\",\n",
       " 'This Père de Famille is 85% Cabernet Sauvignon, with the rest split between Merlot and Petit Verdot. Sweet, pure fruit—black currants and black cherry and blackberry—is packed tight, concentrated and polished, but needing hours to breathe open. Dense, dusty, complex, complicated, this wine is sophisticated beyond description.',\n",
       " \"Raymond returns to form with this 100% Cabernet. It's made in the modern cult style, which emphasizes immediate pleasure at the expense of ageability. With rich cherry, cassis and new oak flavors, the wine is soft enough to open now, and should drink well for the next six years.\",\n",
       " 'Mostly Pinot Noir with some Chardonnay, this bubbly shows the pedigree of these two noble varieties in its balance and elegance.

       " \"Rustic in the best sense, an honest country wine that's clean and satisfying and meant to gulp now. Shows rich berry and spice flavors and is fully dry. The equivalent of two regular bottles at $7.50 each, it's also one of the most charming bottles in California.\",\n",
       " \"Only 500 cases were produced of this thick, tannic, complex wine from Sonoma County. It's cellarworthy and hard, dry and astringent now in dense cherry, cassis and mocha flavors that finish with wonderful length and harmony. You can drink it now, but you must adjust for the tannins. Otherwise, cellar until at least 2008.\",\n",

It's superrich in the mouth, with tons of ripe peach and tangerine flavors and a hint of honeyed sweetness, but it's basically dry. A fine partner for toasted sourdough rounds topped with goat cheese and olive tapenade. Editors' Choice.\",\n",
       " 'Cabernet Sauvignon (68%) takes the lead, with Cabernet Franc, Merlot and Malbec rounding it out. High-toned aromas of graphite, herbs, black cherry, espresso and barrel spices lead to tart flavors that are lighter in style, with the tannins providing some grip.',\n",
       " \"A little sour in acidity, or maybe the acidity sticks out because the raspberry and cherry fruit isn't strong enough. Either way, this dry, silky Pinot Noir is rustic, but it does show real varietal character.\",\n",
       " 'Deep and impressive in fruit. Shows blackberry, black currant, chocolate, grilled meat and pepper flavors that spread across the mouth and finish in a fan of spices. Fully drinkable now, although a bit soft, but the tannins will help it age for the next six years.',\n",
       " 'Shows real Riesling character in the dryness, acidity, crisp citrus and mineral and floral flavors that mark this elegant wine. Easy to drink now, with some noble structural features.',\n",
       " 'This would qualify as a fruit bomb except it is so impeccably balanced, with fine-grained tannins and enough acidity to keep the lush berry fruit flavors from becoming jammy. Boysenberry, blackberry, black cherry and cassis hold down a concentrated core; the density of this wine is captivating.',\n",
       " 'Blackberry and black cherry flavors are right up front, the fruit is definitely the star here. Light suggestions of dried leaf and moist earth add complexity, though in this lighter vintage it does not have the power of previous bottlings. This is a graceful, perfectly balanced wine, whose subtle pleasures will reward those who pay close attention.',\n",
       " \"A bit more concentrated than the '06, but similar in lush, appealing flavors of cherries, raspberries, cedar, cola, vanilla and spices. With a silky texture, it should develop through 2013.\",\n",

       " \"Despite 15.1% alcohol, this is dull, one dimensional and rather light. The tannins are a little beefed up, but there's marginal fruit and everything seems a bit out of whack.\",\n",
       " \"Lovely texture, a smooth but slightly astringent tannic base, good acid and a hint of citrus that lifts and refreshes. It doesn't seem to have the complexity or the sheer power of the 2002 L'Orage, but it's well made and appealing. Flavors of strawberry, raspberry, red cherry, and blueberry carry it.\",\n",
       " 'Full bodied and well-oaked, this full-throttle Zin comes on with intense blackberry and vanilla aromas and flavors accented by cinnamon and chocolate notes. Ripe and even on the palate, the handsome fruit plays out on the lengthy finish with tart, dark berry and pepper notes.',\n",
       " \"This impressive Syrah dazzles with richness. The alcohol is high, but that's the price you pay for fruit this ripe. The heat is balanced by the wine's overall acid-tannin balance and remarkable flavors of chocolate, summer berries, mooshu plum sauce and new ?oak. Drink soon for its exuberant fruitiness.\",\n",
       " 'Misceo is a GSM blend, vinified in a mix of new, once-filled and neutral barrels. The woody flavors and aromas dominate, with hints of sandalwood, cocoa and dust around tart blue fruits.',\n",
       " \"Superfruity and jammy, with massive raspberry, cherry, blackberry and dark chocolate flavors, accented with black pepper. The texture is soft and voluptuous. This Syrah is a bit direct now, with its primary fruit and oak overlay, and it's a little hot, with an official alcohol reading of 15.5%.\",\n",
       " \"After the terrific 2003 Ulysses this is a come-down. Sweaty and tight, with a tart, unyielding palate, this herbal, peppery wine requires some effort. Released too soon? Most certainly, but it's a good question whether the chocolaty oak will ever smooth into the light, tart fruit flavors of red berry and pomegranate.\",\n",
       " \"This is a very nicely rendered Wahluke Slope AVA Syrah, with spicy currant and raspberry fruit underscored with the characteristic lightly citrusy acids. There's a hint of pineapple which resonates just beneath the surface. The wine gathers some strength in the back, adding weight and flavors of plum, cherry and chocolate.\",\n",
       " \"Very ripe and extracted, this has flavors of blackberries and cherries that are a bit heavy-handed. There's a lot of oak influence, too, which adds to the heaviness.\",\n",
       " \"Youthfully fruity now, with sweet, jammy flavors of blackberries, cherries, raspberries, licorice, vanilla oak and spices. Comes from the warm, southern part of Salinas Valley. Could develop, but it's a gamble.\",\n",
       " 'Somewhat heavy and dense now, marked by deep layers of black cherries, licorice, bacon, cocoa, mint and baking spices. Seems at its best now and over the next 2–3 years. Decant before serving.',\n",
       " \"Dark purple in color and stunningly huge, with fresh young fruit, this is a thick, glyceriney Syrah stuffed with blackberry jam, espresso, cinnamon, dark chocolate and peppery notes. So fruity and so rich, but it's also a tannic wine that will benefit from a few years of age.\",\n",
       " \"Crafted from five estate lots, Vino Noceto's Riserva is classic Foothills Sangiovese, with cranberry and dark cherry mingling around a light texture, high acidity and a smooth, caramel finish.\",\n",

       " \"Silhouette is Merryvale's small-production best of barrels blend from the winery's various vineyards. The '08 is a success, showing brisk acidity and new oak and yeast flavors and a creamy texture framing ripe pineapple, pear and mineral flavors. It's an elegant wine that shouldn't be served too cold.\",\n",
       " 'A blend of fruit from three different sites, united by their green farming practices, this is clean, fruity and forward. A mouth-pleasing Pinot with generously juicy and pretty cherry flavors.',\n",
       " 'An awkward wine. High alcohol can work in Zin, but not in this one. It has hot, jalapeño pepper flavors along with cherry and blackberry, and even though the official reading is 15.6%, there seems to be residual sugar and deficient acidity.',\n",
       " \"Although it's slightly rustic, with some sharpness, this is almost the perfect Zin for barbecue or something more prepared, like braised beef or pork ribs. It's a comfort-food red, dry and full-bodied, yet clean, with an honesty that comes from the terroir.\",\n",
       " 'Only slightly grassy and with strong lemony overtones to the fruit, this near-colorless white is as crisp and refreshing as a sea breeze. Would be perfect with the local oysters or clams on the half-shell.',\n",

       " 'Right away this appealing wines bursts out with scents of chocolate and vanilla—the barrels used were Hungarian and American oak. The fruit is ripe with plum and cassis, the wine still tight and the tannins still chewy and hard. But the pleasing aromas promise a good life ahead.',\n",
       " \"Made from the exotic Scheurebe grape, this is a very sweet wine, brimming with pineapple jam, ripe pear and honeysuckle flavors, with an oily, glyceriney fatness. It's balanced with crisp acidity, so the finish is dry and clean. Just delicious now with fruity desserts, vanilla cake or a buttery lemon soufflé.\",\n",
       " 'A Cabernet-based Bordeaux blend that shows lots of fruity character and real elegance. Dry and soft, the blackberry, cassis, cherry and sweet oak flavors are delicious. Drink now.',\n",
       " 'Erupts out from the glass with beautiful Cabernet perfume, suggesting cherry pie from the oven, licorice, sandalwood and dusty dried herbs, like sage and thyme. Very dry, with a long spicy finish, but also quite tannic, although lots of the tannins come from new oak. Best to age this polished 100% Cab for at least six years.',\n",
       " \"Make this wine a little drier and the score would rise. As things are, it's just too sweet and one-dimensional in jammy raspberries and cherries, while oak brings buttered toast and roasted coconut flavors that are candy sweet. Good as it is, it palls after a while.\",\n",
       " 'Sourced from Napa, Lake County and Lodi, this is a complex white wine with quite a bit of sophistication. Mainly Sauvignon Blanc with some Semillon, it shows citrus, peach, flower petal, mineral and vanilla flavors, with crisp acidity and a long, spicy finish.',\n",
       " \"Aged two years in French and American oak, this is a dark and meaty wine, with black fruits and a hint of blood. There's a bit of a hole in the midpalate, but streaks of cola and licorice revive the finish.\",\n",

       " 'Robust and deeply flavored in wild berry, tobacco, smoked meat and spice flavors. A somewhat rustic wine that needs big, rich roasts and barbecue.',\n",
       " 'Kind of harsh, with green, searing acidity. The wine is fully dry and silky, with decent cherry and spice flavors, but it has that cutting quality.',\n",
       " 'Shows the clean acidity and purity this appellation bring to white wines, with savory tangerine, pineapple, green apple and vanilla cream flavors. Lovely as an appetizer wine, or with sole sautéed in butter.',\n",
       " 'This is mostly Tempranillo, with smaller portions of Grenache, Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot in the blend. There is plenty of acidity, some subtle suggestions of blood and fresh herb, along with pale berry fruit and soft tannins.',\n",
       " \"It's uncommon to find Grenache Noir in a white blend, but it's a tasty experiment nonetheless. Well rounded and evenly presented, the nose of lemon and honeysuckle is prominent but delicate. The slightly oily palate comes alive with vanilla, pear candy, peach and bubblegum, finishing with a brush of acidity.\",\n",
       " \"This may do something down the line, but who knows? It's O.K., with sweet-and-sour cherry, herb and oak flavors, and a soft, one-dimensional feeling.\",\n",
       " \"Very rich, very ripe, just enormous. Offers never-ending waves of sour cherry candy, cola, rhubarb pie, cranberry, Asian spice and smoky sandalwood flavors. Complex, but as good as it is, it's compromised by a hard vein of acidity, which accentuates the tannins. Edgy now, but could develop in the bottle. Try after 2010.\",\n",
       " 'Clean and varietal. The fruit tastes of ripe apples, pears, and maybe a little bit of pineapple, and if there is new oak it has been gracefully melded into the wine so it does not stick out. Just a hint of sweet toast adorns the smooth, lingering finish; then fades with a lick of butterscotch at the tail end. A graceful, elegant debut for this new Walla Walla winery.',\n",
       " \"This is subtly perfumed, with hints of apple blossom, white peach and smoke. There's a delicacy that extends from the nose to the palate on this bone-dry, elegantly structured Riesling. Brisk and refreshing, the finish ripples with flavors of crushed stone, shale and lime pith.\",\n",
       " 'Tastes soft and a little tired at the age of six-plus years, with pie-filling raspberry, cherry and spice flavors. A certain dry complexity makes it interesting, but its lifespan is largely exhausted.',\n",
       " 'Reserved in aromas at first, this shows charred wood, red cherries, pomegranate and graphite on the nose. Quite intriguing texturally, the palate is sticky with tannins but light in body, offering flavors of cola and tart cranberry.',\n",

       " \"The most floral of Ponzi's single-vineyard Pinots, this is a delicate and yet powerful wine, scented with lavender and roses, and displaying bright, clean raspberry fruit. Stiff acids and grippy tannins support a wine that is locked down tightly and needs decanting and/or aerating to open up.\",\n",
       " 'Aromas and flavors of sandalwood and grenadine layer around this velvety, seductive wine. It offers black tea, truffle and forest floor, the body sinewy and complex. Savory in cinnamon and clove on the finish, it needs more time to open; decant or cellar through 2021.',\n",
       " 'An awkward wine and, reviewed a mere year after the vintage, difficult to assess. Tastes super-jammy, like it has residual sugar, with candied cherry and raspberry flavors that finish with a caramelized, brown sugary sweetness. Should knit together sometime in late 2010. Released too soon after bottling.',\n",
       " \"A terrific wine whose slight residual sugar of 0.8% is balanced by crisp Monterey acidity that's so firm, the wine finishes dry. Teases the palate with tangerines, Mandarin orange blossom, bosc pears, honeysuckle and vanilla, undergirded by a stony minerality.\",\n",
       " 'Pale in color and already showing some age, with flavors of dried red cherries, rosehip tea, sandalwood and spice. Not a blockbuster, but racy, elegant and delicate.',\n",

Complex, muscular and delicious.\",\n",
       " 'A distinctive Chardonnay made in the Farrell style, which leans toward acidic and elegant. But this is not an austere wine, far from it. It has a rich minerality and flavors of lime and pineapple custard, and then an even richer crème brûlée finish. Delicious and complex.',\n",

       " \"This is a new, reserve-style wine from veteran Ferrari-Carano. It shows its cool-climate origins in the brisk acidity that boosts well-ripened pineapple tart, green apple sauce, and Key lime pie flavors. It's also extremely oaky, and would be a better wine if it had less barrel influence.\",\n",
       " \"Although this is 100% Merlot it is labeled simply Red Wine, as previously the blend has been half Cabernet. With the vines recovering from a bad freeze, Pepper Bridge fruit presented some challenges in 2005. This wine still seems disjointed, with too many green and stemmy flavors wrapped into light streaks of spice and pepper. The strawberry-flavored fruit seems barely ripe. It's light in the center and finishes with a mix of pepper, stem and rather green tannins.\",\n",
       " \"This is complex and compelling. A spicy, minty, thyme-like character comes out in the aroma and continues in the flavor, most likely from some new barrels used in aging the wine.

       " 'A single vineyard, 100% varietal Cabernet Sauvignon, this is deep, dark, dense, chewy and tannic. Yet it still captures some delicate floral aromas as well as smoke and rock and black fruits. You go from flower to fruit to earth and black olive in a rush of full-bodied flavor.',\n",
       " 'Though it opens with a somewhat sweaty nose, once in the mouth this wine settles in to a base of black cherry fruit and earthy tannins. There are streaks of leaf and graphite, plenty of firm acids, and enough weight to out-muscle most inexpensive Merlots from California. Made with organically grown grapes.',\n",
       " 'This blend is concentrated and meaty. It perfectly captures and combines the raspberry intensity of the Grenache, the brambleberry fruit of the Mourvèdre and the peppery smoke and spice of the Syrah.

       " \"With Pinot Noir, texture is everything, and this lovely wine is pure silk and satin. That makes it drinkable now, with its pretty flavors of raspberries, cherries, cola, cinnamon butter and sandalwood. But it's also tannicly tough, with a sandpapery scour. Seems like it should mellow over the next 3–4 years, although not much beyond that.\",\n",
       " \"Hits the nail on the head, with ripe, juicy Cabernet aromas and flavors. There's great fruity extraction, with cassis, black-currant and plum flavors, complex with smoky oak. Despite the depth and concentration, the wine is deft, elegant and very dry. Best Buy.\",\n",
       " \"Nearly as good as the '01 and '02, and in the same vein, a dry, balanced Zin that combines an elegant structure with sour cherry, herb and coffee flavors. Notable for its restraint, in an era when it's all too easy to let Zinfandel ripen to excess.\",\n",

       " \"The 2011 Aurora Vineyard Chardonnay comes across as super rich, without being superripe—a neat trick. It's lush and toasty from the moment the cork is pulled, showing mixed tropical-fruit flavors buoyed with moderate acidity. The perfumed nose carries through in the mouth, almost like a Gewürztraminer.\",\n",
       " 'This is a decadently rich Chardonnay, although it depends for its appeal mainly on oak and ripe fruit, rather than nuance. Explodes with pineapple jam, golden mango, crème brûlée, buttered toast, honey and cinnamon spice flavors. Ready now.',\n",
       " \"Brawny, briary, rustic, tannic, fruity, these are just a few words to describe this wine. It's a true barbecue companion, a big, powerful, full-bodied wine with blackberry and pepper flavors. Drink now and through 2012.\",\n",
       " \"This bottling, from the winery's estate vineyard in the warm Pope Valley region, is ripe and relatively high in alcohol.

This new release is tight, hot and shows signs of reduction; it's got a burnt rubber scent underlying the ultraripe, almost pruny fruit. It's just not a compelling wine; it hasn't jelled and it doesn't seem as if it will. There is concentration and power to be sure, but pleasure is in short supply.\",\n",
       " 'Rather dark and full-bodied for a blush wine, with candied raspberry and cherry flavors and a spicy, vanilla-sweet finish. I like the flavors, but the heaviness and sweetness are awkward.',\n",
       " \"Ed Sbragia is making some of the most interesting single-vineyard Cabernets in California. This one, from Howell Mountain, shows the density and power that typify all his wines.

Feels like it has the capacity to age for decades.\",\n",
       " 'One of the best Californian Pinot Gris currently available, this is rich, creamy and complex, and it would make for a great alternative to Chardonnay.

       " \"What a nice Zin. Shows all the Dry Creek character you could ask for, with briary, brambly flavors of wild forest berries, peppery spices and chocolate-covered mints.

       " 'This wine is restrained on the nose and initially on the palate, showing a touch of reduction and tightly-held flavor. As it opens, it unleashes juicy dark cherry, berry and huckleberry notes, its core dense with tannin and oak.',\n",
       " \"It's tough to improve on Gordon Brothers' outstanding regular release of Chardonnay, a 90-point effort. All too often, the extra ripeness turns subtle nuances into thicker, less complex flavors. Barrel time adds butter and toast. So if you want a ripe, tropical, banana-and-peaches style of Chardonnay, with plenty of buttery oak, this will certainly do the trick. But somehow it seems less interesting than its cheaper sibling.\",\n",
       " \"Palette is a sensational value from one of Walla Walla's still-unrecognized superstar vineyards, Spofford Station. This Cab/Merlot blend is saturated with fruit and beautifully crafted. In a difficult year (2004 froze out most Walla Walla vineyards) it is a rare jewel. Hints of compost, earth, mushroom and other herbal elements add interest, and the wine is buoyed with lively acid.\",\n",
       " \"A tart, all-purpose red, with 14 different grapes in the blend. The result, predictably, is generic. No particular variety dominates; it's a high acid red wine, with stiff tannins.\",\n",

       " \"American and Hungarian oak barrels were used, adding a rustic, powerful base to this pure Primitivo. Think Zinfandel crossed with Lemberger and you're in the ballpark of its style. Its raw, big-boned flavors of fruit and barrel are ready for a juicy steak.\",\n",
       " \"A huge step up from the overoaked regular bottling, this wine offers aromas of smoked meat and bacon fat.  The berry-flavored palate is rich and dense and flows smoothly into a finish that's marked by earth and coffee notes.\",\n",
       " 'Awesomely rich, showing fine acidity and a stony minerality that ground and anchor it, but really notable for the explosive tropical fruit, apricot, pear and buttery oak flavors that are so opulent. The wine went through a complete malolactic fermentation.',\n",
       " 'From a cool, inland section of Mendocino County, this Viognier opens with gorgeous aromatics—heavenly honeysuckle and grapefruit—and offers up crisp, dry, borderline bracing acidity that pulls back just at the right moment. Nicely textured, the finish lingers.',\n",
       " 'Winemaker Mark McNeilly from Mark Ryan Winery makes this estate grown Viognier, and works it in the same strong, substantial, concentrated style as his own release.

It's a wine with bold fruit, low tannins and food-friendly acids, probably best consumed young.\",\n",
       " 'Fully 25% of the wine is Syrah, which adds color and helps to bolster the fruit. Red berries provide a light base for a wine with plenty of barrel flavors of toast and coffee grounds.',\n",

       " \"This full-bodied wine smells ripe and buttery, like a pear tart, and has similar tasty flavors like ripe apple, vanilla and cream. Though it's not technically sweet, the personality is generous and the texture soft and rich.\",\n",
       " \"This wine has been pretty consistent over the years, a dry, crisp sipper, modest in citrus, lemongrass and spice flavors. It's a good cocktail drink, or for picnics and barbecues.\",\n",
       " \"Dry and meaty, with tannic flavors of grilled beef, blackberries, smoky oak, pepper and other spices. Feels dense, solid and vital, a wine that could develop bottle complexity through 2013. It's a blend of Syrah, Petite Sirah and Cabernet Sauvignon.\",\n",
       " \"While this is the most tannic of Envy's wines, it's also made in the house style of soft, fruity approachability. Forward and lush with blackberry jam, currant and spice flavors, it shows an impeccable balance. Wonderful now and over the next 3–4 years.\",\n",
       " \"Tightly wound, with big, edgy tannins that accentuate the acidity. Underneath you'll find dry, elegant flavors of tart cherries, red currants and violets. A polished, pretty wine that could pick up some nuances over the next 2–3 years.\",\n",

       " 'Butter and vanilla wrap around tropical fruit and citrus flavors on the full nose. Baked apples, crème caramel and abundant new oak merge to provide this chard with a slightly viscous, buttery texture. Its rich butter and oak may be a bit too much for some.

Bone dry, with ultra-fine tannins, it's a gorgeous wine now, and should age gracefully for 6–8 years.\",\n",
       " 'With this wine Iron Horse takes a giant step toward great Chablis. By that I mean the intense dryness and zesty acidity, and the tangy grip of iron and wet stone that undergirds the Meyer lemon, pineapple zest, honeysuckle, apricot, cinnamon spice and new oak flavors. This Chard is all about structural integrity. It should have a useful life of at least six years, gaining momentum and nuance.',\n",
       " 'The balance and brightness are immediately apparent, with sweet raspberry and red cherry fruit against some lightly earthy tannins. All in proportion, yet with a bit of extra depth that suggests some ageworthiness. Everything is ripe, but not too ripe, and the acidity feels natural and proportionate.',\n",
       " 'A mix of 37% Zinfandel, 32% Syrah and 31% Petite Sirah, this is a burly, thick and syrupy concoction from a high-elevation vineyard site known for its power and concentration. Sweet vanilla rides a dense wave of tannin and oak, finishing tight and leathery.',\n",

It's got plump and sweetly juicy cherry and berry fruit flavors, mixed in with cherry candy, red licorice, anise and spice. Good persistence and length.\",\n",
       " \"Black pepper is the star of this bone-dry, full-bodied young wine, in both the aroma and the flavor. Below that are bold notes of black currants, plums and leather. The tannins are hard, giving it a mouth-stinging astringency. Your best bet is to cellar it for 3–4 years, but it's somewhat risky.\",\n",
       " \"Sometimes a reserve designation on a Chardonnay simply translates to excessive use of new oak; here it brings a rich abundance of fruit, along with a density and texture rarely found in domestic Chardonnays. This is a fruit salad of a wine, to be sure, running through a farmer's market's worth of peaches, apples, pears, apricots, bananas and more. But it also brings the butter, the butterscotch and the barrel toast, layered in and wrapped around the fruits so it has the richness of a banana split, and some of the creaminess as well.\",\n",
       " \"Part of a Limited Release series, this may be both the most expensive and most alcoholic Cabernet ever made by Chateau Ste. Michelle. Superripe and saturated, it's propped up by balancing acidity, but the alcohol suppresses nuance and terroir. It's a wine to sip slowly, like a young Port.\",\n",
       " 'This single-vineyard 100% Cabernet Franc is firm, juicy and focused. It has a phenolic bite at the back end, along with lemony acids. The concentration of fruit and herb flavors is excellent, which makes it a fine steak wine and also a bottle to stow away for a few more years.',\n",
       " 'From century-old vines growing in a warm part of the valley comes this soft, layered Zin. It shows wild blue- and black-skinned berry fruits that approach raisins, rum punch, cherry liqueur and rosemary-thyme flavors. Tasty Zin, a little simple in structure, but nice and dry.',\n",
       " 'Very vibrant in acidity and bright green fruit character, suggesting limes, lychee and lemongrass. A drop of Viognier and a tiny percent of oak add softening, enriching notes. Very fine and dry. Good with ceviche, grilled veggies on bruschetta topped with melted goat cheese.',\n",
       " \"The Mendocino winemaker, Dennis Patton, who's a real veteran, made this extraordinary wine. A blend of Zinfandel, Petite Sirah, Grenache and Syrah, it's one of the best Rhône-style, field blend-type wines of the vintage, showing lush raspberry, cherry, cassis, gingerbread and herb flavors. A tannic taste of bitter almondskin rounds out the finish.\",\n",
       " \"Ripeness was the issue in this cool vintage, and there's a touch of good old cat pee here. Not too much, but enough to make the wine unattractive despite the nice dryness.\",\n",
       " \"From the Peays, of Marin County, comes this dry, tannic and somewhat rustic Cabernet. It's hard around the edges, with some raisiny notes to the blackberries and toast. Ready now.\",\n",
       " 'A complex and delicious Bordeaux blend, with a bouquet of blackberries, herbs, tobacco and prunes. The nose promises a lot and the palate delivers full, sweet fruit flavors and a rich texture. The finish is long and toasty, with deep fruit and vanilla flavors and solid tannins that indicate good ageability. Best from 2002–2009.',\n",
       " \"There's lots of ripe, pure fruit in this wine, suggesting sour cherry candy, cranberries and red licorice. Texturally, it's softly silky, and the finish is dry. High alcohol shows up on the finish as a not unpleasant jalapeño-like warmth.\",\n",
       " \"The fruit is plenty ripe, offering rich flavors of blackberries and black currants, and the finish is thoroughly dry. The drawback with this Cab is its texture. It's rough and angular, suggesting unevenly ripe stems and seeds. Drink now.\",\n",
       " \"A bit tough in texture, but a very nice Cabernet, with blackberry, black currant and cedar flavors. The roughness won't go away, but you can decant it for an hour or two before serving.\",\n",
       " 'Soft and fleshy, this Cab has forward flavors of berries, chocolate, cedar and spices, with a touch of sweaty leather. Polished and easy to drink now.',\n",
       " 'A wonderfully drinkable sparkling wine that appeals immediately for its balanced texture and rich flavors. Easy to like for its array of raspberries, limes, vanilla, toast and yeast. The sour lees note is nicely balanced with the sweet liqueur of dosage.',\n",
       " 'Young and spicy, with deeply-etched cranberry fruit flavors, limned with leafy herbal tannins. The core of fruit is pretty as can be, and the nicely-managed tannins wrap it in a perfect frame, while giving it added muscle. Another two or three years in the bottle will really bring this into focus.',\n",
       " \"An exceptionally fine Petite Sirah, except don't even think of opening it for a while. Made with a little Merlot, it's a dark, tannic wine, with complex flavors of blackberries, currants, plums, balsamic, tamari, cola, chocolate and dusty spices. But those pesky tannins sting the mouth. Give it until 2010, at least.\",\n",
       " 'Simple and fruity, this is a pleasant, easy-drinking table wine. The Barrel Select designation does not mean oaky.',\n",
       " \"One sip is all it takes to be blown away by this Pinot's beauty. It's exquisitely crafted, a testament to both the vineyard and the winery's oenological talent. The palate is bright and tangy with acidity, and incredibly complex flavors of wild berries, mushrooms, balsam, cola and Asian spices. It's dramatic now, but will continue to improve for at least 15 years.\",\n",
       " 'All of the best barrels are in here, and it shows. This limited (75 case) Bordeaux blend is wonderfully concentrated with sweet, stiff, sappy fruit, Juicy in the mouth, but tightly wound, it is fleshed out with buttery oak flavors of vanilla, toast and caramel. Young, hard and a little bit hostile, this needs major decanting; or stick it away and let it blossom for a decade or more.',\n",
       " \"Dry, silky and tannic, this Pinot shows forward cherry, red currant, cola and cinnamon-nutmeg flavors. It's a good example of a drink-me-now wine with some real complexity and class.\",\n",
       " \"The vineyard is in the cooler Green Valley, and this Pinot shows its terroir in the vital acidity that brightens pure, intense cherry, blueberry and blackberry fruit flavors. It's an elegant wine, but tannic. Give it 4–6 years in the cellar.\",\n",
       " 'The outstanding Elerding vineyard provided the fruit in 2006. From the opening whiff of dried spice, fresh herb, pepper and earth, it opens into a rich palate stocked with wild fruits, moist earth, coffee grounds and leafy forest floor materials. If you enjoy your Syrah on the wild side, you will want a bottle of this.',\n",
       " 'Zesty raspberry meets warm cherry notes on the nose of this elegantly presented wine, which also shows aromas of beet juice, sandalwood, clove, mace and bergamot. The palate is a texturally driven, evolving experience, with flavors of earth, iron and pencil lead melding with sage scrub, wild berries and elderberry.',\n",
       " 'From a Ken Wright-owned vineyard, the Savoya is a lighter style, sprinkled with fresh whiffs of basil, thyme and rosemary, and hints of pine needle. An elegant, almost delicate, wine.',\n",
       " \"This cold-climate vineyard is source to some of the most powerful Chardonnays in California. The '05 shows the massive tropical mango, guava, nectarine, apricot and pineapple flavors the vineyard effortlessly delivers. Almost over the top, it's saved by very crisp acidity.\",\n",
       " \"Rich and flamboyant in blackberries, cherries, chocolate, currants and oak, with a smooth, velvety texture of sweet tannins and soft acidity. Very delicious and flamboyant, although it's missing a certain je ne sais qua. Drink now.\",\n",
       " \"Right out of the bottle, this is tight and acidic. While it's rich in raspberry, cherry and Dr. Pepper flavors, not to mention oak, it's jammy, fresh and direct—in an immature way. Give it a few hours in a decanter and drink it with rich lamb and steak dishes.\",\n",
       " \"Tasted in September ‘07, this Cab was pretty high in tannins, giving it a tough astringency some folks won't like. But the wine is clean and complex, with blackberry, tobacco and sage flavors. It's the opposite of a cult Cabernet, which is to say it's more like a traditional dry Bordeaux than something out of Napa.\",\n",
       " 'Dense, dry and young, this is a Syrah for the cellar. With 10% Petite Sirah, it has some fierce tannins, and is a little soft, but possesses the inherent balance to age. Give it two or three years, then enjoy the hearty cherry, cassis, leather, cocoa and balsamic flavors for a couple more years.',\n",
       " 'Dumas Station draws its fruit from the excellent Minnick Hills Vineyard. This 100% Syrah takes no prisoners: Its superconcentrated flavors of blackberry syrup, maple syrup, espresso, dark chocolate and vanilla rock-and-roll across the palate, propelled by the high alcohol.',\n",
       " 'A marvelous Pinot Noir to drink now and over the next 6–7 years. It feels so rich and elaborate, with waves of raspberries, cherries, cola and oak, yet is tightly controlled by firm tannins and a great burst of citrusy acidity. Grows better and better as it warms in the glass.',\n",
       " \"This is pure Cabernet from one of Washington's oldest vineyards. Cold Creek is a hot site, and its grapes are scattered throughout many of the Ste. Michelle brands, often providing the core fruit. Here is the essence, a wine that opens a bit grudgingly, but has structure and concentration if you take the time to let it blossom. Dense cherry and cassis fruit is tightly wound with balancing acids. The use of new oak is restrained, but sufficient, and this is a wine that should age nicely for many years.\",\n",
       " 'A successful Zinfandel that shows its Dry Creek origins in the classic Zinfandel flavors and structure. Bone dry and not too high in alcohol, it offers a rich array of ripe grilled blackberries, blueberries, black pepper, Dr. Pepper cola and sweet, smoky sandalwood, wrapped into thick, fine tannins.',\n",
       " 'This wine is often closed down upon release, and the 2007 is no exception. Plan on putting it into the cellar, or give it many hours of decanting. It slowly opens with tightly layered red and blue fruits, baking spices, and hints of herb and seed. The finish turns a little chalky.',\n",
       " \"Soft and earthy, this wine's herbal, funky nature suggests Carneros as much as Sonoma Coast, with black tea and crunchy dried cranberry lurking on the back of the palate. Medium in weight, it eases into a mellow finish.\",\n",
       " 'Complex, with tiers of tropical fruit, mineral, and oak flavors that unfold in waves. The wine is dry and opulent in spiced papayas and macaroons, leading to a caramel-like finish.',\n",
       " \"Hard to tell if the dry farming had anything to do with the success of this wine, but it's one of the better Mourvèdres in California. Dry and softly tannic, it offers comforting and complex flavors of berries, cherries, cocoa, pepper and cedar, with exotic notes of roasted coconut, tamari-sautéed wild mushrooms and balsamic. Drink now.\",\n",
       " \"Round, full, fruity and complex, this polished effort's flavors runs the gamut from citrus to stone fruit to light tropical. Generous and elegant at once, it finishes with light notes of cracker and grain.\",\n",
       " \"This is one for the cellar. Dry and savory, it shows powerfully ripe blackberry, cherry, cassis and coffee flavors that have been well oaked, and the silky, elegant texture of Pinot Noir. But there's a youthful tightness that withholds the wine's tender heart. Best after 2008, and will develop for an additional 6 to 10 years.\",\n",
       " \"Grapy and fruity, like it's fresh out of the fermenter. Also sweet and soft, with a melted jam consistency and taste. Drink this simple wine now.\",\n",
       " 'A savory wine made in a slightly sweet style that has flavors of pineapples, peaches, and vanilla oak. Acidity is all-important for balance.The blend is 92% Sauvignon Blanc and 8% Sémillon.',\n",
       " 'Shows the rustic side of Petite Sirah, with big tannins, crunchy acidity and juicy berry, pomegranate, currant, grilled steak and black pepper flavors. Tastes raw and immature now, and should be cellared for 3–4 years.',\n",
       " \"This is a wine made for the cellar. It's dark, and smells rich, with ripe blackberry and plum fruit and a hefty dose of vanilla-scented, smoky oak. Full-bodied, but the tannins are hefty now, and the acidity is high. Probably best to put it away for four or five years and see what happens.\",\n",
       " 'A feminine, almost soft Pinot Noir, this opens nicely with scents of roses, red fruits, and pine forest. Despite its light color, it has plenty of grip and density in the mouth, even bringing some streaks of light milk chocolate into the finish.',\n",
       " \"All of Korbel's new sparklers are good values—when are they not? But this rosé is particularly elegant and delicious. It's not just the strawberries, lemon zest, vanilla and yeasty dough flavors, which are tasty enough, it's the mouthfeel, which shows real Champagne finesse and silkiness. This blend of Russian River Pinot Noir and Sangiovese, Chenin Blanc and Gamay from the Sacramento Delta is addictively drinkable.\",\n",
       " \"Whatever the name SISU means, this is a pretty good wine. It's dry and earthy, with pleasant cherry-berry, Dr. Cola, lavender, sweet cedar, herb and spice flavors that are wrapped into firm tannins.\",\n",
       " \"Great price for a brut this classically structured. Made from Pinot Noir and Chardonnay, it's dry and crisp, with a fine mousse that gives it a creamy smooth mouthfeel. The pineapple, raspberry and vanilla flavors are delicious.\",\n",
       " \"Soft and almost sweet in jammy, pie-filling raspberries and cherries. It's luxuriously soft and silky, with polished tannins, and lots of people will love it. Would benefit from greater depth and complexity, but it sure is lovely. Drink now.\",\n",
       " \"Here's a wine with great bones: nicely structured with firm tannins and good supportive acidity. It's not light and flabby, but it is very drinkable. Flavors? Think of cola laced with black-cherry juice with a dash of Worcestershire. It's very dry, and the long finish turns spicy.\",\n",
       " \"Not only is the name clumsy, so is the wine. It's bitterly dry and tannic, with the flavors coming mainly from caramelized oak. Fundamentally drinkable, but not a very interesting wine.\",\n",
       " 'This is a heavy, syrupy Pinot, with caramelized, candied raspberry, cherry and spice flavors.',\n",
       " \"One of the lusher, richer Pinot Gris on the market. It's dry and crisp in Central Coast acidity, with ripe citrus, peach, vanilla and honey flavors. On the downside is a sugary sweetness that makes it almost a dessert wine.\",\n",
       " 'This Grenache-Syrah blend shows some real complexity in the cherry, leather, tobacco, cola, sandalwood and spice flavors. The tannins are quite refined and entirely ripe. Not an ager, but lovely and elegant now.',\n",
       " \"This is an earthy, homespun, flavorful bottle, with more than a little hint of brettanomyces in the flavors. If you enjoy that saddle leather, horsey quality, this is your wine, as the spicy, sharp, nicely ripened fruit is up to the challenge. It's flavorful with a mix of tropical and red fruits, hints of butterscotch and coffee, and a somewhat hot finish.\",\n",
       " 'This Pinot is not a great representative of this fine vineyard. The wine tastes overcropped, with leafy, tannic flavors of cherry tea, cola and oak. But it has a nice silky texture and is finely dry.',\n",
       " \"Gets the nod for its upfront, juicy flavors of cherries, blackberries, raspberries, plums, chocolate, you name the fruit, it's in there. Yet it somehow maintains dryness and crispness. Yummy stuff.\",\n",
       " \"There's real consistency to Hendry's array of block-designated Chardonnays. This one shares those qualities of earthy, herbal, even tobaccoey notes along with apple and peach flavors. It shares also the dryness and softness. These are very distinct wines, and they have their place in the menu of California Chardonnay.\",\n",
       " \"There are Russian River Pinot Noirs that are dark, heavy and dense, and then there are bottlings like this. It's a silky, light-hearted wine, easy and gentle in the mouth. At the same time, the flavors are complex, with waves of cherries, red currants, cola, pomegranates, mocha and an array of sweet Asian spices. Drink now.\",\n",
       " 'From an estate vineyard off Olivet Lane in the heart of the Santa Rosa Plain, this wine is comparatively intense and meaty compared to some of its counterparts from the cooler Sebastopol Hills. Earthy mushroom and a tart, tangy note of orange give it a lift, along with a light layering of fresh-cut rose, before finishing in richer, dark chocolate.',\n",
       " 'The aromas of this wine are a touch honeyed with notes of baked apple and sweet smoke. The finish is medium length, but the alcohol comes through a bit too aggresively.',\n",
       " 'Lola is a 50-50 Cabernet Sauvignon/Syrah blend, smooth and supple, with a mix of purple berries, black cherry, cassis and smoke. The tannins finish a little green, and the Cab/Syrah combo seems to nullify the clear, varietal expression of either grape, but overall this is a well-crafted wine that could stand nicely alongside a hanger steak.',\n",
       " 'This is a terrifically enjoyable wine from Terre Rouge. It shows a distinct white pepper note in the aroma, and floods the mouth with delicious blackberry jam, dark chocolate, oatmeal raisin cookie, mushu plum sauce and licorice flavors. Easy to drink now, but complex and layered.',\n",
       " 'A lovely Pinot Noir, dry and silky and rich, with complex flavors of raspberries, cherries, Dr. Pepper cola, sandalwood and white pepper. Easy to drink now for its sleekness and elegance. Only 296 cases were produced but a single-vineyard wine worth seeking out.',\n",
       " 'This blend of all the Bordeaux varieties satisfies for its wealth of well-ripened fruit. It just floods the mouth with the flavors of crushed, perfectly ripe blackberries, black raspberries and wild cherries, picked under the warm summer sun. Oak adds smoky nuances. A good job from Madrona. Drink now.',\n",
       " \"Sausal has some of the oldest vines in Sonoma County, and despite ripe raspberry, blackberry, cola and chocolate flavors, this wine has a taste of the earth that must come from the vine roots reaching deep into the soil. It's a lovely, gentle Zinfandel for drinking now.\",\n",
       " 'Nice and dry, with an elegant structure of acids and firm, dusty tannins and a balanced application of oak. However, the wine is a bit thin and lacking in richness, especially compared to Napa. It shows herb-tinged, earthy flavors that suggest black cherries, green olives and golden tobacco.',\n",
       " \"Dry and zesty in acidity, this Chard offers flavors of apricots, green apples, pears and butter cream. It's pretty good for this everyday price.\",\n",
       " \"Old vine Petite Sirah fortified with brandy in the Port style, this very sweet wine could benefit from some time in the bottle. It's quite rich in chocolate, black currant and spice flavors wrapped into smooth, thick tannins, with a burn of alcohol on the finish.\",\n",
       " 'Made from 100% Demeter-certified biodynamic grapes, this wine has a bouquet of baked strawberry tart that makes it unique and full of personality. Amidst that is great peppery and earthy spice as well as a hint of dust, with a long-lasting finish.',\n",
       " \"This is one of the softer Chappellet Cabs, and whether it's because of the hot vintage or a change in winemaking, it's not in the same league as the '02 and '03. Tastes like a melted chocolate bar, with a squeeze of crème de cassis and licorice, and of course new toasted oak. Just too soft. Drink now.\",\n",
       " 'From a cool Forestville vineyard once devoted to apples, Appian Way is rich in Goldridge soils, providing a happy home to these grapes that offer a core of pomegranate and cranberry, laced in black tea. Light bodied without being wimpy, the wine is complex and velvety, finishing in nutmeg and ginger.',\n",
       " \"Don't look for subtlety in this Syrah. It's all about overt, in-your-face ripe blackberry jam, mushu plum sauce and dark chocolate flavors. The wine is dry, tannic and soft, with a long, spicy finish. Doesn't seem capable of aging, as the alcohol is high, so drink up.\",\n",
       " 'A spectacular Pinot that succeeds due to superior structure and complex flavors. With a silky texture, it feels smooth in the mouth, and shows dry, cool-climate flavors of raspberries, cola, oranges and anise, with the most lovely overlay of smoky oak. Beautiful acidity and finely meshed tannins provide the architecture. Drink now–2014.',\n",
       " 'Nice scents of mocha, earth, coffee, cassis and caramel suggest a wine that perhaps was originally intended for a higher price point. It has soft and pliable tannins that give way to streaks of herb and some slightly bitter phenolics. But overall a nice effort.',\n",
       " \"There's a lot going on in this complex Chardonnay. The balance strikes you first, with crisp, zesty acidity cleansing the palate and preparing it for the onslaught of flavor. Then a tsunami of grilled pineapples, Meyer lemon pie filling, crème brûlée, butterscotch and vanilla hits. So devastatingly good, you can't keep your hands off it.\",\n",
       " 'This 50-50 blend of Syrah and Cabernet Sauvignon shows dried strawberries, violets, lilacs, chocolate sauce and cappuccino on the nose. The palate offers dark chocolate, strawberry and cherry flavors, along with a leveling effect from pencil lead and graphite. Watch for a future in this sort of blend from the Central Coast.',\n",
       " \"Dark, robust, dry, full bodied, tannic and acidic. That pretty much sums up this old-fashioned, young wine. It's a serious cellar candidate, stuffed with blackberry jam, leather and coffee flavors. Best after 2010 and for years beyond.\",\n",
       " 'Slightly spritzy and low in alcohol, this dry Riesling has light peach and apricot fruit, spread broadly across the palate. It would be prudent to drink it sooner rather than later.',\n",
       " 'Hard in tannins and bone dry, this Malbec needs rich beef dishes to balance out the astringency. It has a ripe heart of blackberries and currants, and is at its best now. Decant for a few hours.',\n",
       " 'Smoky, heavy toasted oak complements mild tropical fruit, nuts and coconut on the nose. The toasty flavor and a decidedly earthy note reads big against the pineapple, citrus and rich vanilla notes showing in the palate of this even, medium-weight wine. Finishes dry, brisk and slightly tart.',\n",
       " \"This 100% varietal bottling is the first release for this Mirage vineyard designate. Some interesting floral highlights to this wine; the fruit has light flavors of boysenberry and blackberry. Flavors are mostly all up front, without much depth or specific varietal character, but it's pleasant enough. Just a little chalky in the finish.\",\n",
       " 'Soft, rather sweet and appealing. What it lacks in stuffing and complexity, it makes up for in sheer deliciousness. Opulent in raspberries, cherries, red currants, red licorice, Dr. Pepper, bacon, pepper and sandalwood. Drink now–2013.',\n",
       " \"Just beautiful to drink now, despite grippy tannins that give the ripe fruit an astringent mouthfeel. Based on Cabernet Franc, the wine's flavors are simply delicious, offering waves of cherries, blueberries, plums and currants. Plenty of new oak adds toasty vanilla. Those tannins suggest pairing this wine with rich foods, such as lamb, but you don't want to smother the delicacy underneath a rustic stew. Drink soon, before it loses freshness.\",\n",
       " \"A savory, meaty and brooding Sangiovese that's rustic and simultaneously pretty, with an air of soft perfume on the nose. This small-production wine, with tiny bits of Barbera and Primitivo mixed in, would be really good with risotto.\",\n",
       " \"From a single vineyard on Snipes Mountain, this is a forceful, dark and liquorous version of Harrison Hill, which often carries more herbal accents. Here it's fruity and floral, with scents of rose petals and concentrated raspberry and cassis. Still young and showing its alcohol, it needs some hours of decanting.\",\n",
       " \"Few wines out of Napa Valley need age as much as this one does. That's due to its mountain origins and the cool vintage, which combine to make the tannins pushy and hard. But once they start to fall out, the blackberry and currant flavors should emerge, pure and sweet. Best after 2010, but if you open it before that, decant.\",\n",

    "To train our model, we are going to have to convert all of our categorical features (i.e. text) into continuous features (i.e. numbers). This is a very common process that is performed for training Machine Learning models, as features are often categorical in datasets. Machine Learning algorithms work purely with numbers to perform various tasks such as regression (e.g. predicting housing prices when given the square footage and location of a house) and classification (e.g. predicting whether or not a tumor is malignant, given the mass of the tumor). We will convert all of the categorical features except for the description feature, which we will touch on this in a bit."
